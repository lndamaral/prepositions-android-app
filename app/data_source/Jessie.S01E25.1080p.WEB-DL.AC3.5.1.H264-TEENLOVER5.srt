00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:10,200
Aww.

3
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:13,300
I can't believe it's been seven years

4
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:17,080
since we brought Zuri home from Uganda.

5
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:20,420
So Gotcha Day is the day to celebrate
the arrival of an adopted child?

6
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:22,050
Exactly.

7
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:23,390
Gotcha.

8
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,060
Ew!

9
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:30,190
Bertram! This coffee table
is a sticky mess.

10
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:32,430
What? I wiped
it down earlier.

11
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:37,440
And I'd be delighted to do it again.

12
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:40,510
Oh, may I say, ma'am, I know
you've given up modeling,

13
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:43,280
but those ankles are still runway ready.

14
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:45,180
Oh, well.

15
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:48,280
Wow. You can mop up and
kiss up at the same time.

16
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,450
I hope you stretched first.

17
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,290
Hear ye, hear ye.

18
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:02,230
All rise for the Gotcha Day girl.

19
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:06,200
You know her, you love her, you want to
squeeze her till her pigtails pop...

20
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,440
Zuri Ross!

21
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:20,420
Luke, I think you accidentally grabbed
stink bombs instead of smoke bombs.

22
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:22,360
You think?
My brain is melting.

23
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:26,160
I really should organize my prank bag.

24
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,370
I mean, this was just unprofessional.

25
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,200
Bertram, can you please clean this up?

26
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,100
You mean...
The air?

27
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:36,440
I'll get right on it, ma'am.

28
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:42,250
Wow, my Gotcha Day is off
to kind of a stinky start.

29
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,420
Oh, okay, here are the smoke bombs.

30
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:46,420
Yeah.

31
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:49,490
Oh!

32
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,460
For your Gotcha Day, we're
getting you a label maker.

33
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,160
Oh.

00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,430
What a mess!

51
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:57,330
Ooh, chili!

52
00:02:57,370 --> 00:02:58,370
Five-second
rule!

53
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,270
No, it's all dry and crusty.
Oh.

54
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:04,310
Five-minute rule?
No!

55
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:08,450
Morgan, I'm really busy
to be a grown-up. You.

56
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:10,480
Aw, nuts.

57
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,180
Bertram!

58
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:18,460
My chili!
What happened?

59
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:25,060
I just stepped away
the carpet in my bedroom. Cuum.

60
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:28,300
Funny. I've noticed
a lot like snoring.

61
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:31,240
A new belt or something.

62
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:33,210
I'll make sure this gets cleaned up.

63
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:37,480
Well, good, because Zuri's Gotcha Day party
does not need a chili slip and slide.

64
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:40,410
Ooh, can that be a thing?

65
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:44,250
No! Just like the zip line
from our terrace to the park

66
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,490
can't be "a thing."

67
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:49,160
She doesn't understand your vision, sir.

68
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:51,390
I know, right?

69
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:54,430
Hey, Jess, Christina and I have
to pick up Zuri's present.

70
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:56,530
Plus, we have to get
decorations for Zuri's party,

71
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:58,330
sign off on my new shoe line,

72
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:01,270
and meet with the lawyers because,
apparently, my new fragrance

73
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:02,340
is causing bees to attack!

74
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:07,180
I can help, you know,
with Zuri's decorations,

75
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:10,250
not the whole bee attack debacle.

76
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,250
Yeah, wait, wait, wait.
Hey, so, what did you get her?

77
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:15,190
Oh, well, it's a real big secret.

78
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:17,120
We got her a...

79
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:24,200
Ah-ha!

80
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:26,460
Caught you,
snotty-handed.

81
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:30,170
Sneezing on the stakeout.
Rookie mistake.

82
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,370
Aw!

83
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:35,370
Thank you so much, Jessie, for your help.

84
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:38,180
If you get stumped, here
are some decorating ideas.

85
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:40,280
Stumped is not in my vocabulary.

86
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:44,120
Oh, it means to be at a loss for ideas.

87
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:47,090
Right after Zuri's Gotcha Day,
we'll getcha a dictionary.

88
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:48,550
Thanks.

89
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:56,400
Mr. Kipling, finish
your cricket salad

90
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:59,100
or you get no chocolate
covered beetles for dessert.

91
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:03,100
Wow. You're strict.

92
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:05,170
Hey, tough love is still love.

93
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:09,440
Hey. You think you can take a
break from tiger-mommying Kipling

94
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:12,380
to help me brainstorm
my ideas for Zuri's party?

95
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:15,250
I want to do something different
from her birthday two months ago.

96
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,380
As someone who was in the bouncy
house with you when you threw up,

97
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:21,090
I support that.

98
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,460
Christina gave me this list, but
it's just endless variations

99
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,320
of rainbows and unicorns.

100
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,290
For my Gotcha Day, I would
like an Indian theme.

101
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:31,200
Maybe we could get some curry up in here,

102
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:35,330
a snake charmer, a Taj
Mahal ice sculpture...

103
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:37,500
Ooh! That's what
we should do for Zuri!

104
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:41,540
I highly doubt we can get a
Taj Mahal carved in time.

105
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:45,180
Maybe a Gandhi.

106
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:49,110
No, I mean Zuri's Gotcha Day should
reflect where she came from.

107
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:50,550
Africa!

108
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:54,150
Oh! Does the stork drop
babies off in Africa, too?

109
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:55,590
Or is it a flamingo?

110
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:59,260
Hmm. I definitely don't get paid
enough to have this conversation.

111
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:15,340
I am so sick of you kids making me
look bad in front of your parents.

112
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:18,180
You make the messes.
You clean them up.

113
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:20,340
I would never dump your chili on the floor.

114
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,450
That would be cruelty to roaches.

115
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:27,120
Save your breath.
I can see the guilt all over your faces.

116
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:29,490
Uh, these are freckles.

117
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,420
For once, I'm innocent.

118
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:34,230
Oh, yeah, well then what's
this chili on your shirt, huh?

119
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,530
Not chili!

120
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:44,440
Ew! You might as well
lick a taxi cab seat.

121
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:47,340
And, FYI, you should probably
get a round of shots.

122
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:51,240
You kids are driving me crazy!

123
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,280
Bertram, that's not our intention.

124
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:54,550
It's just a happy coincidence.

125
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,360
Okay.

126
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:13,060
I think you might have gone a little overboard
with all these African decorations.

127
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,360
Hey, no one ever got
hurt by going overboard.

128
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,370
Tell that to the people on the Titanic.

129
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:22,410
I've gotta get all these decorations out
to the terrace before Zuri gets back.

130
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,270
Okay.

131
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:25,370
Oh!

132
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:29,140
This lion needed to
cut back on the gazelles.

133
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:32,050
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
ow, ow! Ow!

134
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,320
Ravi!
Get this lion off of me!

135
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:38,450
Funny, those were also the last
words of the orphanage librarian.

136
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:46,330
Oh. Hey, there's
the Gotcha Day girl.

137
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:49,200
Were you trying to sneak a peek
at your party decorations?

138
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:51,270
No, I know what's out there.

139
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:56,070
Unicorns, rainbows,
the yoozhe! I can't wait.

140
00:07:56,110 --> 00:08:01,510
And, uh, what if there were
no unicorns or rainbows?

141
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:04,240
That's a world I would not want to live in.

142
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:09,050
Me neither!
Gotcha!

143
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,250
All right, now, now, go hang out in
your room until your party's ready.

144
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,250
Okay.

145
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,320
I hope I can return a gently used lion.

146
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,190
Done. And the happy look on Zuri's
face will make up for the fact

147
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:31,160
that this tick on my neck
has just drained out my blood.

148
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:36,430
Zuri didn't want Africa.
She wanted the yoozhe!

149
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:39,030
She's not gonna look happy.
She's gonna look like this.

150
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:43,240
She will look constipated?

151
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:47,340
No, no, that was my sad face.

152
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:51,280
See, now I understand why my
drama teacher gave me a D.

153
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:53,080
And that basket of bran muffins.

154
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:10,290
Aah. Wha...
Look at this mess!

155
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,570
Oh!

156
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,440
What are goats doing in here?

157
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:22,240
We destroy, you clean.

158
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:25,340
It's the Circle of Messes.

159
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:31,480
No! Stop it! Stop it!

160
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:33,280
You goats are gonna get me fired!

161
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,650
Bertram? Bertram!

162
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:39,490
Oh!

163
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:42,260
Bertram, what are you doing?

164
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:45,430
Oh. I just had
the craziest dream!

165
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:49,330
There were these four talking
goats making a huge mess.

166
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:54,240
Hey, a baby goat is a kid.

167
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:56,510
I bet we are the kids in your dream!

168
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:59,280
Oh. I am so insightful.

169
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:01,210
I should totally be a seismologist.

170
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:08,420
I guess I've been so worried about
getting fired because of your messes,

171
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:11,220
I... I've been
sleepwalking.

172
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:12,690
More like sleep-messing!

173
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,260
Oh, by the way, if one of
those goats in your dream was

174
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:18,500
really handsome and
break-dancing, that was me.

175
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:28,340
I'm warning you, if you ever have
kids, I'll make omelets out of them.

176
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,250
I should've just stuck to
Christina's list, but no,

177
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,580
I had to think outside the box!

178
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:40,620
And now there's no time to get
back in the stinking box!

179
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:43,490
Jessie, calm down.

180
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:48,260
Maybe we could paint a
rainbow over the savannah.

181
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:52,300
Or better yet, a double
rainbow all the way!

182
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:57,500
That's a great idea!
We can just Zuri-fy everything!

183
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:58,500
Uh...

184
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:05,380
There. That looks
like a unicorn.

185
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:09,610
No, it looks like a zebra in need
of immediate medical attention.

186
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:15,690
Big news!
Bertram finally snapped.

187
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,590
Who had April in the betting pool?

188
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:21,390
Whoa! Why does the terrace
look like Puerto Rico?

189
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:23,230
Oh, it's Africa!

190
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:25,690
Oh! Here, just put
me out of my misery.

191
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:28,230
Just like I did to this poor chump.

192
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:31,700
Jessie, this will be good for Zuri.

193
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:33,470
I mean, we're all spoiled,

194
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,640
and we need to experience bitter
disappointments like this.

195
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,440
Yeah. I think
it's cool.

196
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:42,680
For my Gotcha Day party, I want
lots of stuff from my birthplace.

197
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:46,250
You got it. This whole place will
be covered with decorations from...

198
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,720
Wait, where were you born?

199
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:51,490
Oh, it's a super story.

200
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:54,590
Eight years ago, Mom, Dad, and
Emma were walking in the park...

201
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,600
Oh, Christina, we are so blessed.

202
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:02,730
My new movie is a blockbuster smash.

203
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:08,370
And my new line of perfume is stinking
up magazines all over the world.

204
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:12,540
We have everything we could
ever want from life. Except...

205
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:14,410
The child of our dreams.

206
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:19,320
Not cool, Mom and Dad.
Totes not cool.

207
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:29,660
He's adorable!

208
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:33,400
And strong.

209
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:38,470
Hey! Watch it,
Super Brat!

210
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:40,570
Mama. Daddy!

211
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:43,570
Oh!

212
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:45,510
Can we keep him?
Can we keep him?

213
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:48,240
No!

214
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,650
Oh, of course.
We'll give him Emma's room.

215
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:53,250
No!

216
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,690
Emma, meet your new super brother.

217
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:59,420
No!

218
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:01,560
Stop telling people you
threw me into the sun!

219
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:07,570
Luke, are you implying that
you're actually from Krypton?

220
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,570
Yup. You wanna go
to my Fortress of Solitude?

221
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,570
Nope.

222
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:15,540
We adopted Luke from Detroit,

223
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:19,340
and his only superpower is the ability
to clog toilets with a single poop.

224
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:24,580
Although Luke's origin story
is quite fantastical,

225
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:28,390
my Gotcha Day story is amazing and true.

226
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:31,660
I remember it like it was only
months ago, which it was.

227
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:42,370
Your home is like a palace.

228
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,540
Well, now it's your home too.

229
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:46,470
Welcome to your new room, buddy.

230
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:50,340
We hope you'll love it.
But you know, it's not quite ready yet.

231
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:56,310
<i>Mrs. Mommy and Mr. Daddy</i> <i>must have thought Mr.
Kipling</i> <i>was going to be a baby lizard,</i>

232
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:59,680
<i>because they bought</i> <i>him a small
wooden</i> <i>cage to sleep in.</i>

233
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:05,420
<i>Silly them. Everyone knows</i> <i>rocking a
lizard will put him</i> <i>into attack mode.</i>

234
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:17,200
<i>They bought him tiny outfits,</i> <i>a teddy
bear for a chew toy,</i> <i>and even diapers.</i>

235
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:21,300
<i>I appreciated the thought,</i> <i>even though Mr.
Kipling</i> <i>is more of</i>

236
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:24,370
<i>a boxer-briefs kind of guy.</i>

237
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:25,680
Wait, wait.
Hold the phone.

238
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:28,380
It sounds like your parents
were expecting a baby.

239
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:30,610
Shh!

240
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:33,250
Wha... Which I'm sure
is not the case.

241
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:36,220
No, I mean, like, what do I know?
Nothing. I know nothing.

242
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:39,620
Luke, Emma?
Is this true?

243
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:43,490
Did Mrs. Mommy and Mr. Daddy
think I would be a baby?

244
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,600
So it is true!

245
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:51,430
They wanted a baby!
But I am not a baby.

246
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:59,540
Hey, Ravi. Ravi, I am so sorry!
I didn't mean to upset you.

247
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:06,550
What is upsetting is that my family
wanted a baby instead of me!

248
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:09,420
Who told you that?

249
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,190
Jessie.

250
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:13,420
No, no, no, I didn't!
I mean, I did, but I didn't mean to!

251
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:15,390
Curse my laser-like
deductive reasoning!

252
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:20,260
I never thought I would
find a family to adopt me,

253
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:23,400
and when you did, it was the
happiest day of my life.

254
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,570
But now, I realize I was
just a disappointment!

255
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,270
Ravi, no!
You're not a disappointment.

256
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:35,480
Ravi! Ravi, wait!
Let us explain!

257
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,450
I once fired a nanny
just for wearing plaid.

258
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:49,460
So imagine what I'm going to do to you!

259
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:52,630
Listen, we were gonna have
to tell him sooner or later.

260
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:56,470
Thanks to Jessie, it's sooner.

261
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,540
We weren't going to tell
Ravi until after we died!

262
00:15:58,570 --> 00:15:59,960
Well, how were you going to do that?

263
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:03,370
I don't know, seance? Time machine?
We hadn't worked out the details!

264
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:12,190
Ravi?
Ravi?

265
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:13,220
Are you in here?

266
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,260
Marco?

267
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:18,360
Polo!

268
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:21,170
You tricked me.
Now go away.

269
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,500
I'm busy pouting like the
baby you wished I was.

270
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:29,240
All right, well, if you're not
coming out, then I'm crawling in.

271
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,240
Oh. Friendly tip?
Go in this side.

272
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,480
The other side is where Mr.
Kipling does his business.

273
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:38,320
Sweetie, you know how much we love you.

274
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:42,150
I am so sorry we didn't
tell you the truth earlier.

275
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:44,190
This thing's pretty cool.

276
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,420
We need to get one of these in our room.

277
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:46,490
Morgan!

278
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:49,160
Right after we solve this family crisis.

279
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:54,300
See, Ravi, the orphanage told
us your birth date was in 2011,

280
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:57,200
so we thought we were getting a baby.

281
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:00,510
But it was a typo,
'cause you were born in 2001.

282
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:04,610
But we didn't care how old you were.
We just wanted you.

283
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:09,250
And thank goodness we got you, because
changing diapers is totes gross.

284
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:14,250
And plus, I couldn't
play catch with a baby.

285
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:17,390
Well, not that you're great at catch.

286
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:19,320
But you play a mean game of drop.

287
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:25,400
Thank you, siblings, for trying
to make me feel like I belong.

288
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:30,600
You do belong.

289
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:35,310
There is no doubt in my mind that
you're the kid we were meant to have.

290
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:39,580
There is no doubt in my
mind that I'm gonna cry

291
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:42,180
at this incredibly sweet family moment.

292
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:45,420
Thank you, Kipling.

293
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,190
So, yes.
We were expecting a baby.

294
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:53,130
But all we really wanted was a great kid.

295
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:57,430
And you are one of the greatest
kids in the whole world.

296
00:17:57,470 --> 00:18:01,340
Well, it's hard to argue
with such solid logic.

297
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:07,310
And now that you're here,
our family is complete.

298
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:10,440
Thank you, guys.
Family hug?

299
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,450
Mmm.

300
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:22,360
Complete? That means
they're done having kids.

301
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:30,530
What is this I'm feeling?
Wha... Is it? Is it?

302
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:34,330
Yes, it is.
It's joy!

303
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:38,110
Joy!

304
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:40,410
Wait. There's somebody missing
from this family hug.

305
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,480
Yeah.

306
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:42,480
Jessie?

307
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:44,480
Where's Zuri?

308
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,320
Oh, yeah, Zuri.
Be right back.

309
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:53,250
Okay.

310
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:57,160
Let's get this party started!

311
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:01,360
Yeah, yeah.
About that.

312
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:04,370
I'm so afraid you won't like what
I've arranged for your Gotcha Day.

313
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,140
Everything will be okay,
as long as there's cake.

314
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,370
Ah...

315
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:10,440
No cake?

316
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,280
Why do you look constipated?

317
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,090
Wow!
Rainbows?

318
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,250
Unicorns?

319
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:27,390
And there is a cake!

320
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:29,460
Jessie!
Epic fake-out!

321
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:33,330
It's a Gotcha Day miracle!

322
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,330
Thank you, Jessie.

323
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:40,330
Happy Gotcha Day, Zuri!

324
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:43,370
Bertram, you butlering rascal.

325
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,140
You were in on this, too?

326
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:46,510
Guilty as charged.

327
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:51,140
Bertram, how did you do all this?

328
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:53,350
There's a closet full of
party supplies at the ready.

329
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:55,280
And I got a cake guy on speed dial.

330
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:58,220
I can have cake in my mouth in
five minutes flat. Day or night.

331
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:01,390
Happy Gotcha Day!

332
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:05,520
I've gotcha, gotcha,
gotcha, gotcha, gotcha.

333
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:10,190
This is the best Gotcha Day ever!
Nothing could top it.

334
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:15,230
Oh! You think so, huh?
Well, that sounds like a challenge.

335
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:25,370
You got me a zebra that
can operate an elevator?

336
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:27,440
I love it!

337
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:31,440
Well, actually, sweetie, there was
someone in the lobby who pushed the...

338
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,410
You know what?
Yeah, he's a really smart zebra.

339
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:37,580
Whoa, the stripes don't rub off.

340
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:41,290
Not like that painted donkey at the
petting zoo my dad took me to.

341
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:44,590
He's your zebra, but he's going
to live at the Central Park Zoo.

342
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:49,400
We're letting them adopt him, so
actually, it's his Gotcha Day too.

343
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:51,330
Aw.

344
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:54,270
Come on, Zeebee, you can see
your new home from here.

345
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:57,270
But don't look down.
If Chesterfield's in her bathing suit,

346
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:59,340
she's gonna scare the stripes off of you.

347
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:05,380
The coolest pet I ever got as a kid was a
hamster that could sniff out land mines.

348
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:08,480
He, he wasn't very good.
Rest in peace, Captain Nibbles.

349
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:19,560
Now, you're probably wondering why the
terrace looks like <i>Jumanji</i>.

350
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,130
I'm really...

351
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,470
It's fantastic!

352
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:26,200
...sorry I didn't show
it to you sooner. Ta-da!

353
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,170
This is so amazing!

354
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:30,270
Totally.

355
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:32,540
Everything here reminds me of Uganda.

356
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:35,380
Except for maybe this.

357
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:39,410
It's a unicorn from where I'm from.

358
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:41,380
It's a zebra-corn!

359
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:42,420
It's so cool!

360
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:43,480
Aw.

361
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,320
Thank you, Jessie.

362
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:49,190
Oh. I'm just thankful to be working
for such a wonderful family.

363
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:52,230
Hey, honey, look.

364
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:53,230
It's your mom.

365
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:56,600
That's not funny.
That's not funny.

366
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,300
I can't wait to see what Jessie's
gonna do for Luke's Gotcha Day.

367
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:04,210
Oh, I've got Detroit covered.

368
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,440
I'm thinking some muscle cars and a
Detroit River kiddy pool and, ooh!

369
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,540
Maybe we can rent Eminem for the night?

370
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:13,250
Well, that's all great.
But um, I actually told Luke he was from Krypton.

371
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,220
Was that wrong?

372
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:23,120
There. Spotless.

373
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:26,130
There's not a speck of kid debris left.

374
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,500
Aah! The cushions!

375
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:35,240
It's the goats again!

376
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:37,140
I must be dreaming.

377
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:40,180
That's right, citizen.
You are dreaming.

378
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:42,310
Time to make a super mess.

379
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:46,280
No! No! No!
Aah!

380
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:50,650
Goats! Mess!
Mess!

381
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:53,850
He's definitely dreaming about us.

382
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:55,720
Maybe we should wake him.

383
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,560
Nah. Let him sleep.

384
00:22:57,590 --> 00:22:59,490
He's getting more exercise
than he does when he's awake.

385
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:02,730
No!

386
00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:04,130
