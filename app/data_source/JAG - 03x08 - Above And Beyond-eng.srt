1
00:00:21,446 --> 00:00:25,147
Mr. Culbertson? Mr. Culbertson.

2
00:00:25,325 --> 00:00:26,605
Listen to me.

3
00:00:26,785 --> 00:00:30,913
We'll give you one last chance
to save your worthless life.

4
00:00:31,081 --> 00:00:33,287
<i>Do you wish to die?

5
00:00:34,626 --> 00:00:36,250
We're going in for a closer look.

6
00:00:40,966 --> 00:00:43,124
It is no use, Taz. Finish it.

7
00:00:49,933 --> 00:00:52,305
He wasted our time. Kill him now.

8
00:01:05,907 --> 00:01:07,650
Get on your feet.

9
00:01:07,825 --> 00:01:10,862
On your feet.
What's wrong with you, huh?

10
00:01:12,455 --> 00:01:15,409
- Who are you?
- I'm Navy SEALs.

11
00:01:16,834 --> 00:01:19,207
- You know how to use this?
- I'm a diplomat.

12
00:01:19,963 --> 00:01:22,039
Point and shoot. Let's go.

13
00:01:31,641 --> 00:01:33,680
Let's go, let's go.

14
00:01:36,938 --> 00:01:37,969
My leg.

15
00:01:54,831 --> 00:01:57,666
<i>Following in his father's footsteps</i>
<i>as a Naval aviator,

16
00:01:57,834 --> 00:01:59,743
<i>Lieutenant Commander</i>
<i>Harmon Rabb Jr.

17
00:01:59,919 --> 00:02:02,410
<i>Suffered a crash while landing</i>
<i>his Tomcat

18
00:02:02,672 --> 00:02:05,044
<i>on a storm-tossed carrier at sea.

19
00:02:05,216 --> 00:02:06,794
<i>Diagnosed with night blindness,

20
00:02:06,968 --> 00:02:09,969
<i>Harm transferred to the Navy's</i>
<i>Judge Advocate General Corps,

21
00:02:10,138 --> 00:02:14,432
<i>which investigates, defends</i>
<i>and prosecutes the law of the sea.

22
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:17,436
<i>There, with fellow JAG lawyer</i>
<i>Major Sarah MacKenzie,

23
00:02:17,603 --> 00:02:19,726
<i>he now fights in and out</i>
<i>of the courtroom

24
00:02:19,897 --> 00:02:25,354
<i>with the same daring and tenacity</i>
<i>that made him a top gun in the air.

25
00:03:14,037 --> 00:03:15,697
Undersecretary of State
Lawrence Culbertson

26
00:03:15,873 --> 00:03:18,198
was rescued last night
from Hamas terrorists.

27
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:20,831
A Lt. Curtis Rivers, platoon
commander from SEAL Team 7,

28
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:24,455
got Culbertson out single-handedly.

29
00:03:24,631 --> 00:03:26,173
- Attention on deck.
- As you were.

30
00:03:26,341 --> 00:03:27,456
Leave it to the SEALs.

31
00:03:27,634 --> 00:03:28,832
A worthy sentiment, commander,

32
00:03:29,011 --> 00:03:31,336
since they are the most effective
strike force in the world.

33
00:03:31,513 --> 00:03:32,758
Absolutely, admiral.

34
00:03:32,973 --> 00:03:35,546
Apparently, the president
agrees with me.

35
00:03:35,726 --> 00:03:37,303
He asked the Secretary of Navy

36
00:03:37,477 --> 00:03:41,142
to nominate Lt. Rivers
for the Medal of Honour.

37
00:03:41,314 --> 00:03:44,150
That must have been
one hell of a rescue, sir.

38
00:03:45,318 --> 00:03:49,150
Culbertson's the president's point man
in the Middle East peace talks.

39
00:03:49,322 --> 00:03:52,109
Rivers saved him without regard
for his own personal safety

40
00:03:52,284 --> 00:03:55,285
and accounted
for eight enemy casualties.

41
00:03:56,830 --> 00:04:00,199
Anyway, SECNAV
wants JAG to determine

44
00:04:05,297 --> 00:04:07,455
Not just the incident, major.

45
00:04:07,632 --> 00:04:09,839
The president wants assurance
there is nothing

46
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:12,679
in Lt. Rivers' past
that might cause embarrassment.

47
00:04:12,887 --> 00:04:14,382
To Lt. Rivers or the president?

48
00:04:15,056 --> 00:04:17,263
Lt. Rivers and his men
have returned

49
00:04:17,434 --> 00:04:19,841
to the Naval Special Warfare Centre,
Coronado.

50
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:22,427
You will find him on instructor detail.

51
00:04:22,605 --> 00:04:24,147
All of us to California?

52
00:04:25,233 --> 00:04:27,391
Unless you have other plans.

53
00:04:27,569 --> 00:04:29,478
No, sir.

54
00:04:29,946 --> 00:04:34,240
Good. I expect
a full and fair evaluation.

55
00:04:34,409 --> 00:04:37,196
Ignore the politics.

56
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:41,913
And remember, you need testimony
from two eyewitnesses.

57
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:43,874
Dismissed.

58
00:04:44,043 --> 00:04:45,668
Aye, aye, sir.

59
00:04:48,214 --> 00:04:50,372
And don't let the fact that
I'm a former SEAL

60
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:52,673
influence your decision.

61
00:04:52,844 --> 00:04:54,920
- No, sir.
- Absolutely not, sir.

62
00:04:59,016 --> 00:05:00,676
JAG headquarters, this is...

63
00:05:00,852 --> 00:05:05,348
We just got our orders, Harriet.
We leave in a few hours.

64
00:05:05,523 --> 00:05:08,393
I know it wrecks our plans.

65
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:13,189
I'm gonna miss you too.
I can't wait to get back.

66
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:16,199
Really?

67
00:05:16,951 --> 00:05:19,157
No. It's just that I've heard
that stiletto heels

68
00:05:19,328 --> 00:05:21,819
can be bad for your ankles.

69
00:05:23,124 --> 00:05:26,374
I'll get right on that,
Captain Harwich.

70
00:05:26,836 --> 00:05:29,208
I didn't know Bruce Harwich
wore stiletto heels.

71
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:31,337
Sir, did you know that
the first Navy SEAL who won

72
00:05:31,507 --> 00:05:33,749
the Congressional Medal of Honour
was Senator Bob Kerrey?

73
00:05:33,926 --> 00:05:35,669
Did you know
that you're beet red right now?

74
00:05:35,845 --> 00:05:38,086
You know, he wasn't a senator
when he received the medal.

75
00:05:38,264 --> 00:05:39,592
He was a lieutenant, JG, sir.

76
00:05:39,765 --> 00:05:41,010
Nice diversion, Bud.

77
00:05:41,183 --> 00:05:45,015
Yeah, he lost a leg leading a SEAL raid
against Viet Cong snipers,

78
00:05:45,187 --> 00:05:49,315
but was still able to direct
a counterattack which... Yes, sir?

79
00:05:49,483 --> 00:05:52,021
Get on the computer and pull up
everything you can on Lt. Rivers.

80
00:05:52,194 --> 00:05:55,230
- Let's see who we're dealing with.
- Aye, aye, sir.

81
00:06:07,334 --> 00:06:10,039
I spoke with the Secretary of the Navy
personally about Lt. Rivers.

82
00:06:10,212 --> 00:06:13,129
So why is the Judge Advocate
General Corps involved in this?

83
00:06:13,298 --> 00:06:16,216
This is strictly routine, sir.

84
00:06:16,802 --> 00:06:21,215
My guess is that the SECNAV
is routinely covering his butt.

85
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:24,391
Well, we have no knowledge
of that, sir.

86
00:06:25,352 --> 00:06:27,428
Do you folks believe in heroes?

87
00:06:28,021 --> 00:06:29,053
Yes, sir.

88
00:06:30,315 --> 00:06:31,774
I suppose so.

89
00:06:31,942 --> 00:06:33,816
I never did.

90
00:06:33,986 --> 00:06:38,529
When soldiers shoot at each other, l...
It usually means that I've failed.

91
00:06:39,533 --> 00:06:42,403
But this man, this Lt. Rivers,

92
00:06:43,662 --> 00:06:45,536
he risked his life to protect me.

93
00:06:46,123 --> 00:06:47,665
He never hesitated,
he never doubted.

94
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:51,700
He just stood there in the line of fire,
shooting back,

95
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:54,665
and then he carried me to safety.

96
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,916
He didn't even know me.

97
00:06:59,427 --> 00:07:01,716
That's a true hero.

98
00:07:06,393 --> 00:07:07,768
<i>Navy beans and GI gravy

99
00:07:07,936 --> 00:07:10,509
<i>Navy beans and GI gravy

100
00:07:10,689 --> 00:07:13,358
<i>Gee, I'm glad I joined the Navy

101
00:07:13,525 --> 00:07:16,609
<i>Gee, I'm glad I joined the Navy

102
00:07:16,778 --> 00:07:18,356
Two-sixteen.

103
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:21,068
Halt. Good job.

104
00:07:21,241 --> 00:07:24,360
Ditch your helmets.
Get on your covers. Hurry up.

105
00:07:24,536 --> 00:07:27,702
Come on, move it.
Look sharp. Quickly.

106
00:07:27,872 --> 00:07:30,244
Class, left face.

107
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:33,493
Log bridges. Let's go, let's go.

108
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:35,247
Go, go, go.

109
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:37,710
Get them up, ladies.
Get them up, get them up.

110
00:07:37,882 --> 00:07:39,756
Hurry up. Ready.

111
00:07:39,926 --> 00:07:41,586
Begin.

112
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:43,504
Any of you little kittens wanna quit?

113
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,759
No, sir.

114
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:46,555
I've got cocoa and cookies

115
00:07:46,724 --> 00:07:49,180
for anybody who wants to cash in
their chips and ring the bell.

116
00:07:49,352 --> 00:07:50,597
I've got cake for the officers.

117
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:52,893
- Anybody?
- No, sir.

118
00:07:53,064 --> 00:07:54,772
What do you think this is? <i>GI Jane?

119
00:07:55,233 --> 00:07:56,312
No, sir.

120
00:07:56,484 --> 00:07:57,682
Do you wanna stay and fight?

121
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,023
Hoorah, sir.

122
00:07:59,195 --> 00:08:01,401
- Let me hear you.
- Hoorah, sir.

123
00:08:01,572 --> 00:08:03,648
A SEAL must focus on a mission,

124
00:08:03,825 --> 00:08:07,240
must accomplish his goals
regardless of his injuries.

125
00:08:07,411 --> 00:08:09,949
The pain, the heat, the cold.

126
00:08:10,122 --> 00:08:12,578
We're here to train your minds
as well as your bodies.

127
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:15,034
Your mind can teach your body
how to function.

128
00:08:15,211 --> 00:08:19,422
Your strength is not in your muscles,
it's in your brains.

129
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:21,666
In your brains.

130
00:08:21,842 --> 00:08:25,923
Why don't you get your brains to get
your legs to do another five laps?

131
00:08:26,097 --> 00:08:27,639
Let's go.

132
00:08:29,225 --> 00:08:31,264
- Move it. Let's go.
- Move it. Move it.

133
00:08:31,435 --> 00:08:33,891
- Hurry up. Let's go. Hurry up.
- Move it. Move it.

134
00:08:34,063 --> 00:08:35,225
Hurry up, ladies.

135
00:08:35,398 --> 00:08:38,185
Left face.

136
00:08:38,359 --> 00:08:40,268
About time.

137
00:08:40,444 --> 00:08:43,398
- <i>GI grits and GI gravy</i>
- Lt. Rivers.

138
00:08:43,572 --> 00:08:46,407
<i>GI grits and GI gravy

139
00:08:47,993 --> 00:08:49,535
I'm Lieutenant Commander Rabb,
JAG.

140
00:08:49,703 --> 00:08:51,945
Major MacKenzie.
Lieutenant JG Roberts.

141
00:08:52,122 --> 00:08:54,329
We'd like to talk to you.

142
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,291
Do I have to talk back, sir?

143
00:08:57,711 --> 00:09:00,961
Bronze Star for heroism
in Panama.

144
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:06,631
Freeing a CIA operative in a daring
raid on the Carcel Modelo prison.

145
00:09:06,804 --> 00:09:08,630
And a letter of instruction
for disrespect

146
00:09:08,806 --> 00:09:11,593
toward a superior
commissioned officer.

147
00:09:11,767 --> 00:09:13,973
Nominated for the Navy Cross
for bravery

148
00:09:14,144 --> 00:09:18,640
in capturing an Iraqi oil platform
in the Gulf during Desert Storm.

149
00:09:18,816 --> 00:09:20,725
Denied the Cross
and issued a warning

150
00:09:20,901 --> 00:09:24,068
for violating an order
on the same mission.

151
00:09:24,571 --> 00:09:26,196
If a brother improvises,

152
00:09:26,365 --> 00:09:29,983
especially a brother who's a mustang,
he gets written up.

153
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,494
If a white boy from the academy
does the exact same thing,

154
00:09:33,664 --> 00:09:36,867
he's showing individual initiative.

155
00:09:37,668 --> 00:09:39,577
A brother?

156
00:09:39,753 --> 00:09:44,545
An African-American.
A black man. A negro.

157
00:09:44,716 --> 00:09:47,717
Don't play the race card with us,
lieutenant.

158
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:52,555
Let's get
a couple things straight, major.

159
00:09:53,058 --> 00:09:55,679
One, I don't play.

160
00:09:55,852 --> 00:09:58,853
And two, I'm just stating the facts.

161
00:09:59,022 --> 00:10:02,023
Speaking of facts, lieutenant,

162
00:10:02,192 --> 00:10:04,398
I didn't get much
out of your After Action Report

163
00:10:04,569 --> 00:10:05,684
on the mission in Lebanon.

164
00:10:05,862 --> 00:10:08,780
The information was sketchy at best.

165
00:10:09,449 --> 00:10:11,821
Some write, I fight.

166
00:10:12,243 --> 00:10:14,153
You care to tell us
what happened that night?

167
00:10:14,329 --> 00:10:16,452
I rescued
an Undersecretary of State.

168
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:19,656
Any details?

169
00:10:21,169 --> 00:10:23,292
I'll leave that up to you, commander.

170
00:10:23,463 --> 00:10:25,621
Perhaps you don't understand
our assignment.

171
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:28,468
You wanna make sure
I'm not an embarrassment.

172
00:10:29,385 --> 00:10:31,010
The first thing
the two of you asked me

173
00:10:31,179 --> 00:10:33,136
was about the dings
in my service record.

174
00:10:33,306 --> 00:10:35,299
I know all about the Navy
and its lawyers.

175
00:10:35,475 --> 00:10:38,476
You don't know about us, lieutenant.

176
00:10:38,645 --> 00:10:41,218
And quite frankly,
you're not helping your cause any.

177
00:10:41,397 --> 00:10:44,731
I don't have a cause, commander.
I just do my job.

178
00:10:44,901 --> 00:10:47,522
I let you pencil pushers do yours.

179
00:10:47,695 --> 00:10:50,021
The Navy Cross
won't make me a better SEAL.

180
00:10:51,157 --> 00:10:53,399
Lieutenant, you're not up
for the Navy Cross.

181
00:10:53,576 --> 00:10:55,616
You've been nominated
for the Medal of Honour.

182
00:10:56,454 --> 00:10:59,159
For conspicuous gallantry
and intrepidity

183
00:10:59,332 --> 00:11:01,324
above and beyond the call of duty.

184
00:11:02,293 --> 00:11:03,704
What's the real reason?

185
00:11:03,878 --> 00:11:05,705
The president believes
you've earned it.

186
00:11:09,467 --> 00:11:11,590
Chief, we need to debrief you
about the night

187
00:11:11,761 --> 00:11:13,220
Undersecretary Culbertson
was rescued.

188
00:11:13,387 --> 00:11:15,878
- I'll tell you what I know.
- That would be refreshing.

189
00:11:16,557 --> 00:11:18,514
Lt. Rivers
not much of a talker, ma'am?

190
00:11:18,684 --> 00:11:20,095
Tell us what happened that night.

191
00:11:20,269 --> 00:11:24,349
Okay. We came ashore
in two Zodiacs.

192
00:11:24,523 --> 00:11:27,608
<i>And we left them</i>
<i>at the insert-extract point

193
00:11:27,777 --> 00:11:30,943
<i>and proceeded south</i>
<i>to an observational rally point,

194
00:11:31,113 --> 00:11:33,355
<i>about 300 yards from where</i>
<i>the hostage was being held.

195
00:11:37,953 --> 00:11:39,613
<i>We were there for recon.

196
00:11:39,789 --> 00:11:41,615
<i>A Ranger team was tasked</i>
<i>with the rescue,

197
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:43,617
<i>and they were due in ten minutes.

198
00:11:43,793 --> 00:11:45,453
What happened
to change the mission, chief?

199
00:11:46,003 --> 00:11:49,004
Lt. Rivers believed Culbertson
was in imminent danger.

200
00:11:49,173 --> 00:11:50,548
The Rangers hadn't shown up yet,

201
00:11:50,716 --> 00:11:53,172
so the lieutenant decided
to do a closer recon on the building.

202
00:11:53,928 --> 00:11:58,554
He took Douglas with him.
Douglas got hit.

203
00:11:58,724 --> 00:12:00,384
The lieutenant went in on his own.

204
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:01,934
Is that standard procedure?

205
00:12:02,102 --> 00:12:05,103
There is nothing standard about
the lieutenant's procedures, ma'am.

206
00:12:05,814 --> 00:12:06,894
It's getting hot out here.

207
00:12:07,066 --> 00:12:09,354
Why don't we go inside?
My wife's making some lemonade.

208
00:12:10,819 --> 00:12:13,654
Did you see Lt. Rivers
pull Culbertson out?

209
00:12:13,822 --> 00:12:16,111
No, sir. We were taking fire
from the sentries.

210
00:12:16,283 --> 00:12:18,821
They had my full attention.

211
00:12:18,994 --> 00:12:21,070
We've got company, honey.

212
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:23,620
Be right there.

213
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:26,408
- Please.
- Thanks.

214
00:12:27,169 --> 00:12:29,624
So, what do you think about
what the lieutenant did, chief?

215
00:12:31,465 --> 00:12:33,256
He's the real deal SEAL, sir.

216
00:12:33,425 --> 00:12:34,706
So you admire him?

217
00:12:34,885 --> 00:12:38,088
Lieutenant is a result-oriented
person, ma'am.

218
00:12:38,263 --> 00:12:39,841
Is that good or bad?

219
00:12:40,015 --> 00:12:42,423
The men are often
challenged by his orders, sir.

220
00:12:42,601 --> 00:12:45,353
Well, isn't that his job to test you?
To keep you combat-ready?

221
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:48,687
The lieutenant likes to improvise.

222
00:12:49,274 --> 00:12:51,516
Isn't that what SEALs
are trained to do, improvise?

223
00:12:51,693 --> 00:12:52,724
No, ma'am.

224
00:12:52,903 --> 00:12:55,061
No, you plan your dive
and you dive your plan.

225
00:12:55,697 --> 00:12:59,695
A year and a half ago,
we lost our explosives man in Angola.

226
00:12:59,868 --> 00:13:01,742
It didn't have to happen.

227
00:13:01,912 --> 00:13:04,866
Six months ago during
downed-pilot training in Nevada,

228
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,076
three members of our team
were injured rappelling into a ravine.

229
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:10,453
You don't like the lieutenant,
do you, chief?

230
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:14,085
The lieutenant and I
have never socialized.

231
00:13:14,257 --> 00:13:15,716
Does that answer
your question, sir?

232
00:13:15,884 --> 00:13:19,253
So how does it feel to be taking orders
from an African-American, chief?

233
00:13:20,055 --> 00:13:21,763
Anybody thirsty?

234
00:13:23,642 --> 00:13:25,718
I'm used to that, sir.

235
00:13:26,353 --> 00:13:31,145
Commander Rabb, Major MacKenzie,
my wife, Sandy.

236
00:13:33,026 --> 00:13:35,232
- Hi.
- Hello.

237
00:13:35,653 --> 00:13:36,898
You see, commander,

238
00:13:37,071 --> 00:13:39,741
I don't object to Lt. Rivers
because he's black.

239
00:13:39,908 --> 00:13:42,992
I object to him
because he gets people killed.

240
00:13:56,761 --> 00:13:59,299
Commander Rabb.
Major MacKenzie.

241
00:13:59,472 --> 00:14:01,844
Jon Barrow,
special assistant to the president.

242
00:14:02,016 --> 00:14:03,047
It's good to meet you.

243
00:14:03,434 --> 00:14:04,845
How is the investigation going?

244
00:14:05,394 --> 00:14:08,395
Well, we don't have enough
information to form an opinion yet, sir.

245
00:14:08,731 --> 00:14:11,566
Well, that's a politician's answer,
commander.

246
00:14:11,734 --> 00:14:13,062
Is there a problem?

247
00:14:13,235 --> 00:14:15,691
Not that we know of.
We just wanna be thorough.

248
00:14:15,863 --> 00:14:18,401
I support that.
The lieutenant's an African-American.

249
00:14:18,574 --> 00:14:21,243
It's important he be afforded
fair treatment.

250
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:24,577
- As should a man of any colour, sir.
- Agreed.

251
00:14:24,747 --> 00:14:29,076
But keep in mind, in World War II,
433 Medals of Honour were awarded

252
00:14:29,251 --> 00:14:30,710
but none to African-Americans.

253
00:14:30,878 --> 00:14:32,621
Until the current administration.

254
00:14:32,796 --> 00:14:35,122
That's correct.
Fifty years after the fact.

255
00:14:35,299 --> 00:14:39,131
Mr. Barrow, you are not suggesting
we make up for past discrimination

256
00:14:39,303 --> 00:14:41,260
by awarding the medal to someone
who hasn't earned it, are you?

257
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:46,590
Commander, the president believes
that awarding the medal to a minority

258
00:14:46,769 --> 00:14:48,761
would promote national healing.

259
00:14:48,937 --> 00:14:51,393
It would help bring us together.

260
00:14:51,565 --> 00:14:53,107
For a good photo op.

261
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:56,651
<i>GI dressed for GI training

262
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:59,572
<i>GI dressed for GI training

263
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:02,657
<i>Gee, I'm glad I joined the Navy

264
00:15:02,826 --> 00:15:05,531
<i>Gee, I'm glad I joined the Navy

265
00:15:05,704 --> 00:15:08,029
Mind if we join you, lieutenant?

266
00:15:08,665 --> 00:15:10,207
Come for the meat loaf?

267
00:15:11,293 --> 00:15:12,407
It's my favourite.

268
00:15:12,586 --> 00:15:14,662
I've already told you everything
you need about me.

269
00:15:14,838 --> 00:15:16,712
Okay, let's talk about the meat loaf.

270
00:15:16,882 --> 00:15:20,749
I bet it's a hell of a lot better
than the MRE's in Desert Storm.

271
00:15:22,179 --> 00:15:24,504
You led the SEAL diversion
at Mina Saud, didn't you?

272
00:15:27,517 --> 00:15:29,806
They came up in Zodiacs,
swam to shore.

273
00:15:29,978 --> 00:15:31,721
Laid C-4 down along the beach.

274
00:15:31,897 --> 00:15:34,648
Man, you must have been close
enough to the Iraqis to smell them.

275
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:38,768
Yeah, one of them
almost stepped on my head.

276
00:15:39,946 --> 00:15:41,322
They detonated the plastique.

277
00:15:41,489 --> 00:15:43,281
First, we planted buoys in the water.

278
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:45,526
As if you were marking the way
for landing craft?

279
00:15:45,702 --> 00:15:47,326
Right.

280
00:15:47,495 --> 00:15:49,203
When that C-4 went off,

281
00:15:49,372 --> 00:15:52,373
the Iraqis thought we were doing
an amphibious landing.

282
00:15:52,542 --> 00:15:54,285
And then Stormin' Norman
took the troops

283
00:15:54,461 --> 00:15:56,370
and the armour right over ground.

284
00:15:56,546 --> 00:15:58,503
It was great.

285
00:15:58,673 --> 00:15:59,788
So it was all a feint?

286
00:16:01,259 --> 00:16:03,168
Right.

287
00:16:03,344 --> 00:16:06,049
Just like the three of you pretending
to love my sea stories.

288
00:16:09,934 --> 00:16:12,721
Just trying to make conversation,
lieutenant.

289
00:16:12,896 --> 00:16:15,351
You got something to ask me,
then ask it.

290
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:17,565
All right.

291
00:16:18,735 --> 00:16:20,312
How do you get along
with Chief Wilkins?

292
00:16:20,737 --> 00:16:21,816
That's between us.

293
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:24,688
Do you want this medal, Rivers?

294
00:16:24,866 --> 00:16:26,111
It's just a trinket.

295
00:16:26,284 --> 00:16:27,743
You know,
General Patton once said

296
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:30,532
he would sell his soul
for the Medal of Honour.

297
00:16:30,705 --> 00:16:32,365
General Patton wasn't a SEAL.

298
00:16:35,418 --> 00:16:37,790
We don't do what we do
for the ribbons, ma'am.

299
00:16:38,337 --> 00:16:40,247
Men die for their buddies.

300
00:16:41,257 --> 00:16:42,716
Others die for their country.

301
00:16:43,509 --> 00:16:46,344
And some die for no reason at all.

302
00:16:46,512 --> 00:16:51,055
But no one, no one I know,
ever died for a medal.

303
00:16:51,976 --> 00:16:53,969
Excuse me.

304
00:16:57,565 --> 00:16:59,688
Let's go, ladies,
up and down, up and down.

305
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,181
Come on, hurry up.

306
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,567
Let's go. Get up. Get up, get up.

307
00:17:04,405 --> 00:17:06,563
Rolling.

308
00:17:06,741 --> 00:17:09,029
Rolling. Rolling. Rolling.

309
00:17:10,077 --> 00:17:12,284
Let's go. Roll, roll here.

310
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:16,532
Back in the water.
Back in the water.

311
00:17:17,293 --> 00:17:20,662
Back in the water.
Back in the water.

312
00:17:20,838 --> 00:17:22,665
Let's go.

313
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:26,884
It would be helpful if you moved
once in a while, lieutenant.

314
00:17:29,179 --> 00:17:30,211
What's going on?

315
00:17:30,389 --> 00:17:33,260
That's Leonard Kress
from <i>World Update Magazine.

316
00:17:33,642 --> 00:17:36,014
The lieutenant is the subject
of a photo essay.

317
00:17:36,186 --> 00:17:39,686
Kind of a day-in-the-life diary
of a battle hero.

318
00:17:39,857 --> 00:17:41,600
The thing is he's not very animated.

319
00:17:41,775 --> 00:17:43,104
I wouldn't ask him to smile.

320
00:17:43,277 --> 00:17:44,771
We're not even sure
those muscles work.

321
00:17:46,613 --> 00:17:48,820
Hurry up. Hurry up, hurry up.

322
00:17:50,784 --> 00:17:53,275
Out of the water. Out of the water.

323
00:17:53,454 --> 00:17:55,576
Let's go, let's go. Hurry up.

324
00:17:55,747 --> 00:17:58,583
Go, go, go. Hurry up, hurry up.

325
00:18:00,377 --> 00:18:02,085
They got your sister, puke.

326
00:18:02,254 --> 00:18:04,293
They're doing nasty things to her.

327
00:18:04,673 --> 00:18:07,544
You're the only one who can save her.
Save her.

328
00:18:07,718 --> 00:18:09,342
Come on, save her.

329
00:18:09,511 --> 00:18:11,302
No, this crab's got a soft shell.

330
00:18:11,471 --> 00:18:13,678
Throw him back in a pot
and we'll have him for dinner.

331
00:18:15,559 --> 00:18:17,966
Skeevers, don't do it.

332
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:22,685
Simon, get back with your class.
He's no longer a member of this class.

333
00:18:22,858 --> 00:18:24,934
Catch up. Hurry up.

334
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:27,683
Put your legs in the air.
Put your legs in the air.

335
00:18:27,863 --> 00:18:30,899
- Hurry up.
- Well, that's not gonna play.

336
00:18:31,074 --> 00:18:32,983
Let's go. Hurry up. Come on.

337
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,236
Hurry up, hurry up. Come on.

338
00:18:35,412 --> 00:18:38,033
What's going on?

339
00:18:38,206 --> 00:18:40,876
There were sentries on the roof
of the building,

340
00:18:41,042 --> 00:18:43,035
and I took a hit in the gut.

341
00:18:43,211 --> 00:18:45,085
Are you gonna be all right?

342
00:18:45,714 --> 00:18:49,083
I lost 6 feet of my large intestines,
ma'am.

343
00:18:49,259 --> 00:18:52,213
I'm gonna have to wear a bag
and eat Cream of Wheat

344
00:18:52,387 --> 00:18:53,929
for the rest of my life.

345
00:18:54,097 --> 00:18:55,128
Petty Officer Douglas,

346
00:18:55,306 --> 00:19:00,811
we are looking for confirmation of
Lt. Rivers' actions during the rescue.

347
00:19:00,979 --> 00:19:02,259
I'm afraid I can't help you, sir.

348
00:19:02,439 --> 00:19:04,016
Why is that?

349
00:19:05,233 --> 00:19:07,558
Because I didn't see
the lieutenant's actions,

350
00:19:07,735 --> 00:19:11,187
other than he took out a guard
and entered the building.

351
00:19:11,364 --> 00:19:12,609
Then I got hit.

352
00:19:13,199 --> 00:19:16,070
And after that,
I didn't see anything else.

353
00:19:16,244 --> 00:19:20,906
Next thing I know, Chief Wilkins
was bending over me in the boat.

354
00:19:21,082 --> 00:19:22,909
How do you feel about Lt. Rivers?

355
00:19:25,378 --> 00:19:28,295
Lt. Rivers is the leader
of my team, sir.

356
00:19:29,132 --> 00:19:32,216
Do you have an opinion about whether
he deserves the Medal of Honour?

357
00:19:34,012 --> 00:19:39,053
Well, as far as I'm concerned,
there were no heroes that night.

358
00:19:41,394 --> 00:19:43,600
We're looking for details,
Petty Officer Hannah.

359
00:19:43,771 --> 00:19:45,930
There are gaps in our understanding
of the events.

360
00:19:46,107 --> 00:19:47,898
I'll do what I can, sir.

361
00:19:48,067 --> 00:19:51,483
Did you witness Lt. Rivers
rescue Undersecretary Culbertson?

362
00:19:51,654 --> 00:19:53,196
No, sir, I did not.

363
00:19:53,364 --> 00:19:55,772
I thought SEALs
were trained to be observant.

364
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:58,702
Yes, ma'am.
We're also trained to be smart.

365
00:19:59,745 --> 00:20:01,821
Are you saying
Lt. Rivers wasn't smart?

366
00:20:02,999 --> 00:20:05,122
I'm saying Lt. Rivers was stupid.

367
00:20:05,293 --> 00:20:07,700
In what way?
What happened that night?

368
00:20:08,754 --> 00:20:10,794
Lt. Rivers was listening
to the kidnappers

369
00:20:10,965 --> 00:20:12,957
through a parabolic mike.

370
00:20:13,134 --> 00:20:14,628
We're going in for a closer look.

371
00:20:14,802 --> 00:20:16,795
Lieutenant, the Rangers will be here
in ten minutes.

372
00:20:16,971 --> 00:20:19,640
The hostage will be dead by then.
We're going in.

373
00:20:19,807 --> 00:20:21,800
Our mission is recon,
not rescue, sir.

374
00:20:21,976 --> 00:20:24,052
I changed our mission.
You got a problem with that?

375
00:20:24,228 --> 00:20:26,137
That's affirmative.
We are not prepared for rescue.

376
00:20:26,313 --> 00:20:28,187
We're prepared
if I say we're prepared.

377
00:20:28,357 --> 00:20:30,682
We've got no plan, no backup.

378
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:33,315
This is my plan, this is my backup.

379
00:20:33,487 --> 00:20:35,278
Your plans get people killed.

380
00:20:35,447 --> 00:20:36,610
What did you say?

381
00:20:37,658 --> 00:20:38,986
With all due respect, sir,

382
00:20:39,159 --> 00:20:41,235
changing this mission now
is reckless and irrespon...

383
00:20:41,412 --> 00:20:43,737
Tell that to the man inside
who's gonna be executed.

384
00:20:43,914 --> 00:20:45,658
We don't know that for sure.

385
00:20:46,834 --> 00:20:48,577
Are you refusing to obey my order?

386
00:20:48,961 --> 00:20:50,123
No, sir.

387
00:20:50,295 --> 00:20:51,873
- Douglas.
- Aye.

388
00:20:52,047 --> 00:20:54,372
You and I are going up
to the building to recon.

389
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:57,041
The others will stay here
for cover and backup.

390
00:20:57,219 --> 00:20:59,508
- Move it out.
- Roger.

391
00:21:04,351 --> 00:21:06,723
By attacking the building,
Lt. Rivers revealed our presence.

392
00:21:06,895 --> 00:21:08,687
He also endangered the hostage.

393
00:21:08,856 --> 00:21:11,014
But if he believed
Culbertson was about to be killed...

394
00:21:11,191 --> 00:21:13,943
Culbertson was a valuable hostage.
Why would they suddenly kill him?

395
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:15,486
So the lieutenant acted recklessly?

396
00:21:15,654 --> 00:21:17,693
Yes, ma'am.
That's what I've been saying.

397
00:21:17,864 --> 00:21:20,320
- Thank you, petty officer.
- You're welcome, sir.

398
00:21:20,492 --> 00:21:22,864
As you were.

399
00:21:23,245 --> 00:21:26,411
We're trying to reward someone
for needlessly endangering his men?

400
00:21:26,581 --> 00:21:28,704
It's only one man's testimony, Mac.

401
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:31,331
Yeah, but it's the only testimony
we've got.

402
00:21:32,212 --> 00:21:34,169
- Aye, aye, sir.
- What are you doing?

403
00:21:34,339 --> 00:21:36,711
Move it, move it, move it. Come on.

404
00:21:38,593 --> 00:21:42,176
What is your problem, mister?
What is your problem?

405
00:21:42,347 --> 00:21:43,545
You make me sick.

406
00:21:43,723 --> 00:21:45,383
You are the sorriest bunch of pukes

407
00:21:45,559 --> 00:21:47,598
I have ever had the misfortune
to have to train.

408
00:21:47,769 --> 00:21:49,311
Why don't you go
join the Coast Guard?

409
00:21:49,479 --> 00:21:52,314
Well, not your typical
medal-winning personality.

410
00:21:52,482 --> 00:21:55,234
Lt. Rivers' medal
is in serious jeopardy, Bud.

411
00:21:55,402 --> 00:21:56,812
He may not only lose the medal.

412
00:21:56,987 --> 00:22:00,272
He could very well be facing
a charge of dereliction of duty.

413
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:28,895
Ambulance chasing?

414
00:22:30,105 --> 00:22:31,897
Social call.

415
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:34,858
Well, I would venture a guess,
lieutenant,

416
00:22:35,027 --> 00:22:37,315
that you have never been married.

417
00:22:37,487 --> 00:22:38,982
If the Navy wanted me
to have a wife,

418
00:22:39,156 --> 00:22:42,110
they would have issued me one
with my dog tags and my seabag.

419
00:22:43,076 --> 00:22:46,161
Being the wife of a Navy SEAL
is no picnic.

420
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:50,114
All the separations,
they don't know where you are.

421
00:22:50,292 --> 00:22:53,661
Doesn't promote
a real close relationship.

422
00:22:55,088 --> 00:22:57,544
I saw what it did to my parents.

423
00:22:57,716 --> 00:23:00,088
I don't want no part of it.

424
00:23:03,263 --> 00:23:06,798
My dad, he loved the Navy.

425
00:23:06,975 --> 00:23:09,513
Never made it
above the rank of seaman.

426
00:23:10,187 --> 00:23:13,638
That's him in the middle.
Seaman Edgar Rivers.

427
00:23:13,815 --> 00:23:16,437
Would have made
one hell of an officer.

428
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:18,567
Never made it out of the galley.

429
00:23:18,737 --> 00:23:20,943
Do you know, in the history
of the United States Navy,

430
00:23:21,114 --> 00:23:24,234
there wasn't a black officer
until near the end of World War II?

431
00:23:24,409 --> 00:23:26,034
Yeah, the Navy's making up for that.

432
00:23:26,202 --> 00:23:28,776
Yeah, a little too late for my father.

433
00:23:29,622 --> 00:23:32,327
He lived and breathed the Navy.

434
00:23:32,834 --> 00:23:36,417
Until he died. He died in the brig.

435
00:23:37,672 --> 00:23:41,255
Busted in rank and broken in spirit.

436
00:23:41,426 --> 00:23:43,217
What was the offence?

437
00:23:46,055 --> 00:23:49,389
Someone stole some money
out of the officer's wardroom.

438
00:23:50,143 --> 00:23:51,685
They blamed my pop.

439
00:23:52,645 --> 00:23:54,768
Court-martialed him.

440
00:23:56,524 --> 00:23:58,849
He hanged himself in his cell.

441
00:24:00,945 --> 00:24:02,938
I'm sorry.

442
00:24:03,114 --> 00:24:06,400
Six months later, a white bosun's mate
admitted to the crime

443
00:24:06,576 --> 00:24:09,530
after being busted
doing the same thing on another ship.

444
00:24:11,372 --> 00:24:13,697
JAG officer prosecuted my father.

445
00:24:14,667 --> 00:24:19,246
Another one defended him.
Neither one of them believed him.

446
00:24:22,133 --> 00:24:26,131
Well, that explains why you feel
the way you do about Navy lawyers.

447
00:24:26,512 --> 00:24:30,592
I was just a toddler at the time.
I don't really remember much.

448
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,517
But I did read the letters
that he wrote my mom

449
00:24:34,687 --> 00:24:36,596
while he was in prison.

450
00:24:37,023 --> 00:24:39,062
No bitterness.

451
00:24:39,734 --> 00:24:42,521
Not one shred of hate in the man.

452
00:24:42,695 --> 00:24:44,569
He must have had a big heart.

453
00:24:46,073 --> 00:24:47,567
He did.

454
00:24:53,831 --> 00:24:55,788
It doesn't run in the family, though.

455
00:25:00,087 --> 00:25:02,922
<i>Strangers in the night

456
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:07,586
<i>Exchanging glances</i>
<i>Wondering in the night

457
00:25:07,761 --> 00:25:09,920
That is so sweet.

458
00:25:10,097 --> 00:25:11,260
Harriet?

459
00:25:11,432 --> 00:25:12,546
What? I can't hear you.

460
00:25:12,725 --> 00:25:14,516
It's Bud Roberts Jr.

461
00:25:14,685 --> 00:25:16,512
Let me call you later
when I get to the room.

462
00:25:16,687 --> 00:25:18,146
I miss you.

463
00:25:18,314 --> 00:25:20,602
Me too. Bye.

464
00:25:22,151 --> 00:25:25,187
- Machine?
- Yeah.

465
00:25:25,362 --> 00:25:28,447
Excuse me,
could I get another pineapple?

466
00:25:28,615 --> 00:25:30,323
- Sure.
- Three in one night.

467
00:25:30,492 --> 00:25:31,690
You surprise me, Bud.

468
00:25:31,869 --> 00:25:34,075
I'm drowning my sorrows, ma'am.

469
00:25:34,246 --> 00:25:37,282
You got it bad, lieutenant.

470
00:25:38,584 --> 00:25:41,750
Permission to speak freely, ma'am?

471
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:45,918
Look at the black kettle
calling the pot the same thing.

472
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:49,089
I am not lovesick, Bud.

473
00:25:49,261 --> 00:25:53,093
You called the commander Dalton.

474
00:25:53,849 --> 00:25:55,129
I did not.

475
00:25:55,309 --> 00:25:57,515
Yes, you did. Twice.

476
00:25:59,313 --> 00:26:01,720
I can't believe
he didn't say anything.

477
00:26:01,898 --> 00:26:05,018
I think he's just afraid
of losing you, ma'am.

478
00:26:08,655 --> 00:26:10,446
You're leaving JAG,
aren't you, ma'am?

479
00:26:12,325 --> 00:26:14,365
No one's offered me
anything yet, Bud.

480
00:26:15,328 --> 00:26:16,704
What if they do?

481
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,198
Excuse me.

482
00:26:21,751 --> 00:26:24,539
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to the thing.

483
00:26:28,967 --> 00:26:34,471
I'd like to dedicate this to
the most important woman in my life.

484
00:26:42,689 --> 00:26:48,193
<i>I saw the light on the night</i>
<i>That I passed by her window

485
00:26:50,363 --> 00:26:55,488
<i>I saw the flickering shadows of love</i>
<i>On the blind

486
00:26:57,912 --> 00:27:03,417
<i>She was my woman

487
00:27:05,628 --> 00:27:11,085
<i>As she deceived me</i>
<i>I watched and went out of my mind

488
00:27:13,511 --> 00:27:18,220
<i>My, my, my, Delilah

489
00:27:21,018 --> 00:27:27,638
<i>Why, why, why, Delilah

490
00:27:27,817 --> 00:27:29,394
You know, I would have...

491
00:27:29,569 --> 00:27:31,561
I would have thought
you were a cigar man.

492
00:27:31,737 --> 00:27:35,071
I would be if they didn't
taste like goat patties.

493
00:27:37,118 --> 00:27:40,569
I like them. Goat patties.

494
00:27:40,746 --> 00:27:44,874
Well, if they could roll
a bottle of Jack in a tobacco leaf,

495
00:27:45,042 --> 00:27:47,082
it would be a different story.

496
00:27:50,172 --> 00:27:52,628
You know, my mother used to say

497
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:56,418
that stars were holes poked
in the black curtain of night.

498
00:27:57,179 --> 00:28:00,963
It was God's way of letting us know he
was watching us from the other side.

499
00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:04,719
That's kind of nice.

500
00:28:05,938 --> 00:28:07,895
Yeah.

501
00:28:08,566 --> 00:28:11,353
I did most of my killing at night.

502
00:28:12,778 --> 00:28:15,483
I guess it didn't have
much influence, huh?

503
00:28:22,997 --> 00:28:25,832
Lieutenant, I'm gonna be
honest with you.

504
00:28:26,458 --> 00:28:28,036
One of your men has accused you

505
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:31,330
of endangering the team and
the hostage the night of the rescue.

506
00:28:32,214 --> 00:28:36,840
He claims you were out of control
and acted without discretion.

507
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:40,510
You must think you've got me drunk
enough to answer your questions.

508
00:28:43,892 --> 00:28:48,305
He blames the casualties
on your inadequate leadership skills.

509
00:28:50,315 --> 00:28:52,985
I'm giving you an opportunity
to defend yourself.

510
00:28:53,902 --> 00:28:56,476
The truth shall not set us free.

511
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,691
If you actually believe that,
then I pity you.

512
00:29:03,286 --> 00:29:06,987
Look, it's going to take a lot
more than cigars

513
00:29:07,165 --> 00:29:11,626
and bourbon and your pity
to get anything out of me.

514
00:29:12,671 --> 00:29:16,004
Oh, yeah? What would it take?

515
00:29:21,179 --> 00:29:23,801
Do you know the secret to happiness,
commander?

516
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:27,472
Not yours, I don't.

517
00:29:28,186 --> 00:29:29,384
Then I can't help you.

518
00:29:40,573 --> 00:29:43,029
<i>I don't know but I've been told

519
00:29:43,201 --> 00:29:45,739
<i>I don't know but I've been told

520
00:29:45,912 --> 00:29:48,533
<i>Eskimo women are mighty cold

521
00:29:48,707 --> 00:29:51,873
<i>Eskimo women are mighty cold

522
00:29:52,043 --> 00:29:54,581
Admiral, I can't
squeeze it out of him.

523
00:29:54,754 --> 00:29:56,913
Without Lt. Rivers' account
of the events,

524
00:29:57,090 --> 00:29:59,248
I have to rely
on the testimony of his men.

525
00:29:59,425 --> 00:30:02,130
- Which is damning?
- <i>Yes, sir.

526
00:30:03,721 --> 00:30:05,548
And if you had to make
a decision now?

527
00:30:05,723 --> 00:30:07,218
I'd cancel medal considerations

528
00:30:07,392 --> 00:30:11,010
and proceed with an investigation
into misconduct in the field.

529
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:13,762
Look, commander,

530
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:15,979
the SECNAV is getting pressure
from the White House.

531
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:19,270
He's expecting us
to give him some relief.

532
00:30:19,445 --> 00:30:21,936
I understand that, sir.
We're feeling it here too.

533
00:30:22,115 --> 00:30:23,657
Well, there's gotta be
another way in.

534
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:28,613
The lieutenant is a hard case, sir.
He has zero support.

535
00:30:28,788 --> 00:30:31,575
With the exception
of Undersecretary Culbertson.

536
00:30:31,749 --> 00:30:34,620
The man saved my life,
for God's sake.

537
00:30:34,794 --> 00:30:36,418
I'm sorry if his men
were put in danger,

538
00:30:36,587 --> 00:30:39,588
but correct me if I'm wrong,
isn't it a dangerous job?

539
00:30:39,757 --> 00:30:42,426
- Damn straight.
- So, what's the problem?

540
00:30:42,593 --> 00:30:46,757
There seems to be some concern
about Lt. Rivers' behaviour in the field.

541
00:30:46,931 --> 00:30:50,929
It's extremely rare for a SEAL team
to publicly question one of their own,

542
00:30:51,102 --> 00:30:52,216
especially their superior.

543
00:30:52,395 --> 00:30:56,060
Are you saying that
the lieutenant is not worthy?

544
00:30:56,232 --> 00:30:58,059
His men have raised
serious questions.

545
00:30:58,234 --> 00:31:02,183
Was the lieutenant in control?
Was his attitude acceptable?

546
00:31:02,363 --> 00:31:03,857
Was he correct
in changing the mission?

547
00:31:04,031 --> 00:31:05,858
Yes, I would say, selfishly.

548
00:31:06,033 --> 00:31:07,444
Here.

549
00:31:08,619 --> 00:31:10,327
I understand how you feel, sir,

550
00:31:10,496 --> 00:31:13,413
but if the lieutenant
is to be awarded this medal,

551
00:31:13,582 --> 00:31:15,326
I need more than just your gratitude.

552
00:31:15,501 --> 00:31:17,209
For example?

553
00:31:18,629 --> 00:31:21,001
You were the only eyewitness
to the rescue.

554
00:31:21,173 --> 00:31:23,047
Can you remember anything else
about it?

555
00:31:23,968 --> 00:31:25,462
Anything in particular?

556
00:31:25,636 --> 00:31:28,637
Any details
you may have overlooked.

557
00:31:28,806 --> 00:31:32,139
What do you remember about
what went on after the firefight?

558
00:31:32,309 --> 00:31:34,978
Well, after the lieutenant
brought me out of the building,

559
00:31:35,145 --> 00:31:38,680
he hid me behind some rocks,
and then, when he came back, he...

560
00:31:38,857 --> 00:31:41,146
Wait a minute.
Came back from where?

561
00:31:41,318 --> 00:31:42,349
I don't know.

562
00:31:42,528 --> 00:31:46,110
I saw this big red flare,
and then he reappeared

563
00:31:46,281 --> 00:31:48,570
and he carried me out of there.

564
00:31:48,742 --> 00:31:51,826
Did Lt. Rivers send up a flare
after Culbertson's rescue?

565
00:31:51,995 --> 00:31:53,655
Yes, sir. A red pop-up.

566
00:31:54,122 --> 00:31:55,866
Thanks. Why?

567
00:31:56,041 --> 00:31:58,413
That was to notify us
of Petty Officer Douglas' position.

568
00:31:59,878 --> 00:32:01,503
Douglas was down?

569
00:32:01,672 --> 00:32:02,703
Yes, sir.

570
00:32:02,881 --> 00:32:06,630
So the lieutenant took responsibility
for Douglas' safety as well?

571
00:32:06,802 --> 00:32:08,130
Oh, with all due respect, ma'am,

572
00:32:08,303 --> 00:32:11,055
he would not have needed to be saved
if he hadn't been in danger.

573
00:32:11,223 --> 00:32:13,215
You're a difficult man
to impress, chief.

574
00:32:13,392 --> 00:32:16,346
Sir, Petty Officer Douglas
was wounded badly.

575
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,346
It was not a time for enthusiasm.

576
00:32:19,231 --> 00:32:22,896
For the moment,
put aside the fact that Lt. Rivers

577
00:32:23,068 --> 00:32:25,523
changed the mission
and consider the events of the rescue.

578
00:32:25,695 --> 00:32:28,151
- Can you do that?
- Yes, sir, I can do that.

579
00:32:28,323 --> 00:32:30,612
What is your opinion now
of what Lt. Rivers did?

580
00:32:30,784 --> 00:32:33,322
Do you know the first rule
of a SEALs team, sir?

581
00:32:34,663 --> 00:32:35,694
Enlighten us, chief.

582
00:32:37,165 --> 00:32:38,707
Never leave your man.

583
00:32:38,875 --> 00:32:40,073
What are you saying?

584
00:32:40,252 --> 00:32:43,205
Douglas was by himself
when we got there.

585
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:46,499
The lieutenant fired the flare
and then left.

586
00:32:46,675 --> 00:32:48,050
With Culbertson on his back.

587
00:32:48,218 --> 00:32:50,341
Yeah, but he
abandoned his man, sir.

588
00:32:51,721 --> 00:32:54,391
All right, what if Lt. Rivers
stayed behind to help Douglas,

589
00:32:54,557 --> 00:32:57,131
and as a result, the Undersecretary
Culbertson was killed?

590
00:32:57,310 --> 00:32:59,303
That would be unfortunate.

591
00:32:59,479 --> 00:33:03,726
But that rule exists for the sake
of undersecretaries everywhere.

592
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:06,272
Our bond
is what makes SEALs successful.

593
00:33:08,738 --> 00:33:12,652
So Lt. Rivers seriously violated
the SEAL code?

594
00:33:15,328 --> 00:33:17,783
How the hell do you...?

595
00:33:18,539 --> 00:33:19,571
Admiral?

596
00:33:19,749 --> 00:33:22,418
I'm here. We're running out of time.
What do you have?

597
00:33:22,585 --> 00:33:26,036
<i>Well, sir, apparently,</i>
<i>Rivers left Douglas alone

598
00:33:26,214 --> 00:33:28,621
in the process of rescuing
Undersecretary Culbertson.

599
00:33:29,008 --> 00:33:31,048
Oh, this is bad news, commander.

600
00:33:31,219 --> 00:33:33,425
Well, he did it
to save Culbertson's life, sir.

601
00:33:33,596 --> 00:33:34,711
<i>It doesn't matter, major.

602
00:33:34,889 --> 00:33:38,009
SEALs do what they do
because they can rely on each other.

603
00:33:38,184 --> 00:33:41,220
The team is everything.
You never leave your man.

604
00:33:41,395 --> 00:33:43,435
So we've discovered, sir.

605
00:33:43,606 --> 00:33:46,773
So there's no one left to talk to.
We've gotten everyone's story.

606
00:33:48,444 --> 00:33:50,567
Not everyone's.

607
00:33:53,199 --> 00:33:55,441
Your version of the rescue,
lieutenant.

608
00:33:55,618 --> 00:33:59,532
No evasions, no games, no crap.

609
00:33:59,705 --> 00:34:02,955
Just straight talk, huh? Man to man.

610
00:34:03,584 --> 00:34:04,959
I say what happened,

611
00:34:05,127 --> 00:34:08,792
and you two dedicated lawyers,
seekers of the truth,

612
00:34:08,964 --> 00:34:10,507
will take my word for it, right?

613
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:12,674
Well, that depends
on what you tell us.

614
00:34:15,429 --> 00:34:18,513
- I figured as much.
- Sit down, lieutenant.

615
00:34:18,974 --> 00:34:20,848
We're not done.

616
00:34:24,146 --> 00:34:27,562
So here's what we know so far.
You're an irresponsible leader.

617
00:34:27,733 --> 00:34:31,351
A Rambo who puts his men's lives
in danger.

618
00:34:31,528 --> 00:34:33,320
Is there anything else
we should know?

619
00:34:33,489 --> 00:34:35,149
If there is,
you better tell us right now

620
00:34:35,324 --> 00:34:37,815
because, frankly,
we are tired of asking.

621
00:34:37,993 --> 00:34:40,994
Good. Then maybe if you get
tired enough, you'll just go away.

622
00:34:41,163 --> 00:34:42,622
After what happened to your father,

623
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:44,498
we understand
how you feel about lawyers.

624
00:34:44,666 --> 00:34:47,240
You don't know anything
about me or what I do.

625
00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:49,211
You don't have the right
to understand me.

626
00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:50,755
Oh, I know you, Rivers.

627
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:53,794
You're a hard-assed mustang
with a chip on your shoulder,

628
00:34:53,967 --> 00:34:56,293
using your father as an excuse.

629
00:34:56,470 --> 00:34:58,344
I can do anything I want

630
00:34:58,514 --> 00:35:00,636
because Seaman Edgar Rivers
was persecuted.

631
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:05,100
Stop it. Back off, lieutenant. Do it.

632
00:35:09,566 --> 00:35:11,689
Good thing you got a woman
to protect you, commander.

633
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:13,769
Any time, any place, Rivers.

634
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:15,274
Are you stepping up to the plate?

635
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:16,822
I can handle anything you got.

636
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:18,271
I got the last day of hell week.

637
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:20,359
Why don't you put on greens
and join the party?

638
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:22,160
What?
So you can push me around?

639
00:35:22,329 --> 00:35:23,657
You can handle anything I got.

640
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:28,907
All right, I'll go.
You tell me your story and I'll be there.

641
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:30,165
Are you serious?

642
00:35:30,337 --> 00:35:33,006
You make it through the day,
I'll give you my biography.

643
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:34,413
Deal.

644
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:45,052
Commander.

645
00:35:45,229 --> 00:35:46,557
I hope you're ready for this.

646
00:35:49,483 --> 00:35:52,401
Welcome to the last phase
of SEAL training, commander.

647
00:35:52,570 --> 00:35:55,108
You've been captured by the enemy.

648
00:35:55,281 --> 00:35:59,409
Your task is a simple one.
All you have to do is survive.

649
00:36:00,286 --> 00:36:01,863
Lawyers.

650
00:36:03,956 --> 00:36:05,533
Is something wrong?

651
00:36:05,708 --> 00:36:08,199
That old night blindness thing
acting up again?

652
00:36:10,963 --> 00:36:13,252
That's what it indicates
in your service record, isn't it?

653
00:36:13,424 --> 00:36:16,543
Crashed a Tomcat
on the carrier deck at night.

654
00:36:16,719 --> 00:36:17,917
It's okay. Look at me.

655
00:36:20,139 --> 00:36:22,843
What was the name of your RIO,
buddy, huh?

656
00:36:23,016 --> 00:36:26,765
Was he a nice guy?
Was he your friend, huh?

657
00:36:26,937 --> 00:36:30,270
He liked you, didn't he?
He trusted you, he had to.

658
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,350
He put his life in your hands.

659
00:36:32,526 --> 00:36:34,602
The stupid sucker. It's clear.

660
00:36:36,446 --> 00:36:38,688
How do you like
answering the questions now?

661
00:36:40,325 --> 00:36:44,240
What do you think?
A lawyer with nothing to say.

662
00:36:49,751 --> 00:36:51,329
You want to take a shot at me,
commander?

663
00:37:01,471 --> 00:37:02,550
Lieutenant.

664
00:37:02,722 --> 00:37:03,802
What?

665
00:37:03,974 --> 00:37:06,891
Take it easy. You're supposed
to test him, not break him.

666
00:37:09,145 --> 00:37:10,308
Anything else?

667
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,979
- Yeah. I'll get the corpsmen.
- You do that.

668
00:37:19,823 --> 00:37:21,566
You know the secret of happiness,
lieutenant?

669
00:37:26,371 --> 00:37:29,574
You can defeat the pain, Curtis.
It's all in your mind.

670
00:37:33,086 --> 00:37:36,502
Or would you rather cash in
your chips and ring the bell?

671
00:37:39,342 --> 00:37:40,457
Tell me everything.

672
00:37:40,635 --> 00:37:44,336
- What you've heard is right.
- Stop stonewalling me.

673
00:37:45,056 --> 00:37:46,799
I've got nothing to add.

674
00:37:46,975 --> 00:37:48,469
Make something up.

675
00:38:00,113 --> 00:38:01,144
Get out of here.

676
00:38:03,199 --> 00:38:06,900
No, no, no, let's go.
Come on, come on, come on.

677
00:38:20,883 --> 00:38:23,172
Tell me what happened.

678
00:38:23,719 --> 00:38:26,008
Tell me what you heard.

679
00:38:28,266 --> 00:38:31,681
You needlessly endangered
your men.

680
00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:34,893
And you believe that?

681
00:38:35,439 --> 00:38:38,226
Three of your team were injured.

682
00:38:38,401 --> 00:38:40,607
Plus the hostage.

683
00:38:42,113 --> 00:38:44,070
Anything else?

684
00:38:45,699 --> 00:38:48,570
You broke the SEAL code.

685
00:38:48,744 --> 00:38:50,820
You left your man.

686
00:38:52,373 --> 00:38:54,330
Is it true?

687
00:38:56,252 --> 00:39:00,581
I don't have to defend myself to you,
to them or to anyone.

688
00:39:00,756 --> 00:39:04,457
The mission I took was to save
the Undersecretary of State.

689
00:39:05,052 --> 00:39:06,926
I did that.

690
00:39:08,389 --> 00:39:10,049
Why do your men resent you?

691
00:39:10,224 --> 00:39:12,015
Resent me?

692
00:39:12,184 --> 00:39:13,762
They hate my guts.

693
00:39:13,936 --> 00:39:15,596
Why?

694
00:39:16,939 --> 00:39:21,435
Because I operate instinctively,
regardless of their wishes.

695
00:39:24,446 --> 00:39:26,273
They still follow you.

696
00:39:26,448 --> 00:39:29,864
They have to. I outrank them.

697
00:39:31,537 --> 00:39:33,197
It's not because...

698
00:39:33,372 --> 00:39:35,660
They respect you.

699
00:39:41,129 --> 00:39:43,620
You went back for Douglas?

700
00:39:44,549 --> 00:39:46,044
Yeah.

701
00:39:46,218 --> 00:39:49,302
You lit a flare so the others
would come find him.

702
00:39:50,305 --> 00:39:52,464
Did Douglas tell you that?

703
00:39:52,641 --> 00:39:55,346
He was unconscious.

704
00:39:55,519 --> 00:39:57,227
Is that what he said?

705
00:39:57,396 --> 00:39:59,187
Wasn't he?

706
00:39:59,356 --> 00:40:01,230
Whatever.

707
00:40:02,317 --> 00:40:06,267
Why won't you speak
on your own behalf, lieutenant?

708
00:40:08,657 --> 00:40:13,651
Because all the medals in the world
won't make you a better leader.

709
00:40:24,005 --> 00:40:25,962
Commander,
what happened to you?

710
00:40:26,132 --> 00:40:29,086
It's a long story.
How are you feeling?

711
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:31,512
About the same.

712
00:40:31,888 --> 00:40:34,011
- Depressed?
- A little.

713
00:40:34,182 --> 00:40:37,349
- Bitter?
- What do you mean, sir?

714
00:40:37,519 --> 00:40:40,520
Are you angry?
Feel you got a raw deal?

715
00:40:41,773 --> 00:40:43,600
Some, I suppose.

716
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:45,188
Is that why you lied to me?

717
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,558
Sir?

718
00:40:46,736 --> 00:40:49,025
You weren't unconscious
during the rescue, were you?

719
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:55,202
You're a lousy liar,
Petty Officer Douglas.

720
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:58,371
Probably not enough practise.
Try the truth.

721
00:40:58,539 --> 00:40:59,738
The truth?

722
00:40:59,916 --> 00:41:02,241
The truth is he gets nominated
for a medal.

723
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:04,494
And I get to be an invalid
for the rest of my life

724
00:41:04,671 --> 00:41:06,497
because he couldn't wait.

725
00:41:06,673 --> 00:41:10,338
You saw him pull Culbertson out.
You saw him kill the terrorists.

726
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:12,917
You saw him carry Culbertson
to safety, didn't you?

727
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:17,047
Yes, sir, I did.

728
00:41:17,225 --> 00:41:18,304
So what?

729
00:41:19,268 --> 00:41:21,391
Did Lt. Rivers abandon you?

730
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:24,599
He came over there.

731
00:41:24,774 --> 00:41:28,985
I told him to get out of there,
get the hostage down to the beach.

732
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:32,320
He fired a flare to mark my position.

733
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:35,656
And when he saw our men
heading towards us, he left.

734
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:38,068
A minute later, the guys were there.

735
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:40,364
So he didn't abandon you?

736
00:41:41,791 --> 00:41:42,989
No.

737
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:46,828
Maybe he deserves the medal,
I don't know.

738
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:50,669
But I wouldn't wanna serve
with him again.

739
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:57,595
I mean, not that I have
need to worry about that.

740
00:41:57,765 --> 00:42:00,434
Lt. Rivers deserves the medal.

741
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:02,677
You deserve a little relief.

742
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:04,764
Let go of the anger.

743
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:07,097
Forgive the man
so you can get on with your life.

744
00:42:07,274 --> 00:42:09,397
I won't forgive him.

745
00:42:10,569 --> 00:42:14,104
But I won't lie anymore.

746
00:42:16,116 --> 00:42:18,073
What are you looking for, sir?

747
00:42:19,953 --> 00:42:21,745
I'm looking for a second eyewitness.

748
00:42:25,292 --> 00:42:27,534
You got one.

749
00:42:41,767 --> 00:42:43,309
Thank you.

750
00:42:46,271 --> 00:42:50,020
Together on this day,
we offer a prayer for peace

751
00:42:50,192 --> 00:42:52,481
and a tribute to those who defend it.

752
00:42:53,528 --> 00:42:56,695
Together on this day,
we say thank you

753
00:42:56,865 --> 00:43:02,868
to those who step forward to safeguard
our security and our ideals.

754
00:43:03,038 --> 00:43:05,908
What better way
to express our gratitude

755
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:11,421
than by presenting this country's
highest military decoration for valour?

756
00:43:11,588 --> 00:43:13,794
Mr. Undersecretary?

757
00:43:13,965 --> 00:43:15,673
Mr. President.

758
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:21,505
For his conspicuous gallantry
and intrepidity

759
00:43:21,681 --> 00:43:25,181
at the risk of his life above
and beyond the call of duty,

760
00:43:25,352 --> 00:43:30,179
Lt. Curtis Rivers,
United States Navy, an American hero,

761
00:43:30,357 --> 00:43:33,808
is hereby awarded
the Medal of Honour.

762
00:43:49,459 --> 00:43:52,910
Your nation thanks you
and may God bless you.

763
00:43:53,087 --> 00:43:54,879
Thank you, sir.

764
00:45:17,296 --> 00:45:19,703
I would have followed you
anywhere.
