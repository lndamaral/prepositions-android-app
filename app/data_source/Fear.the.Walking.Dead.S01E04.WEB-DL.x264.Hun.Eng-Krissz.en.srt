00:00:19,186 --> 00:00:21,687
<i>"Perfect Day" playing</i>

2
00:00:31,098 --> 00:00:35,134
<i>Just a perfect day</i>

3
00:00:35,136 --> 00:00:40,172
<i>Drink sangria
in the park</i>

4
00:00:40,174 --> 00:00:42,174
<i>And then later</i>

5
00:00:42,176 --> 00:00:46,578
<i>When it gets dark,
we go home</i>

6
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:55,287
<i>Just a perfect day</i>

7
00:00:55,289 --> 00:01:00,125
<i>You made me
forget myself</i>

8
00:01:00,127 --> 00:01:04,096
<i>I thought
I was someone else</i>

9
00:01:04,098 --> 00:01:06,432
<i>Someone good...</i>

10
00:01:07,301 --> 00:01:09,501
Chris's voice:
<i>Another one burned last night.</i>

11
00:01:09,503 --> 00:01:10,769
<i>Better than TV.</i>

12
00:01:10,771 --> 00:01:14,473
People outside the fence,
they took the last of them four days ago.

13
00:01:14,475 --> 00:01:18,077
<i>People just like us
run like cattle,</i>

14
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:20,712
piled into trucks,
one suitcase apiece.

15
00:01:20,714 --> 00:01:23,449
<i>Headed east.
At least that's the rumor.</i>

16
00:01:23,451 --> 00:01:27,119
<i>Bakersfield, Vegas,
who knows?</i>

17
00:01:27,822 --> 00:01:31,290
<i>You just keep me
hanging on...</i>

18
00:01:31,292 --> 00:01:33,158
Chris's voice:
<i>It's safe inside the fence.</i>

19
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:37,396
<i>Outside, everything's dead,
everyone's gone.</i>

20
00:01:37,398 --> 00:01:40,332
This is, uh, day nine.

21
00:01:40,334 --> 00:01:43,535
Nine days since
the lights went out

22
00:01:43,537 --> 00:01:46,205
<i>and that fence went up</i>

23
00:01:46,207 --> 00:01:49,308
<i>and our little green friends
moved in.</i>

24
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:50,509
Soldier:
<i>Let's roll!</i>

25
00:01:50,511 --> 00:01:53,278
Travis says
we're the lucky ones.

26
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,149
<i>He'd throw those dudes a
parade if they'd let him.</i>

27
00:01:57,151 --> 00:02:02,287
And, look, we are grateful
to our saviors,

28
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:04,890
<i>to the ones who protect us,</i>

29
00:02:04,892 --> 00:02:06,725
to those who know

30
00:02:06,727 --> 00:02:10,162
<i>when it's feeding time
at the zoo.</i>

31
00:02:10,164 --> 00:02:13,732
Turns out there's nothing you'll ever
take that nature won't take back.

32
00:02:14,768 --> 00:02:16,835
<i>It all belongs
to her again.</i>

33
00:02:16,837 --> 00:02:21,273
And the dogs
and the dead and the...

34
00:02:21,275 --> 00:02:26,445
<i>You just keep me
hangin' on</i>

35
00:02:26,447 --> 00:02:31,583
<i>You just
keep me hangin' on...</i>

36
00:02:31,585 --> 00:02:33,318
Hello.

37
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:05,817
Hey, we have to repaint
the family room.

38
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:06,785
We did last week.

39
00:03:06,787 --> 00:03:08,253
I know, it needs
a new coat.

40
00:03:08,255 --> 00:03:10,222
Travis found some more
paint in the garage.

41
00:03:10,224 --> 00:03:11,623
What's the point?

42
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:13,859
Semi-gloss.
What? Excuse me?

43
00:03:13,861 --> 00:03:15,761
I mean, no one's coming
to the open house, Mom.

44
00:03:15,763 --> 00:03:16,895
Market's taken
a bit of a turn.

45
00:03:16,897 --> 00:03:18,830
I can still
see the stains.

46
00:03:18,832 --> 00:03:21,733
Hey, you can see the ocean.

47
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:25,571
What? Still not on?

48
00:03:25,573 --> 00:03:29,741
Oh, they probably don't want to
strain whatever's left of the grid.

49
00:03:29,743 --> 00:03:30,909
Don't worry.

50
00:03:30,911 --> 00:03:33,512
They're gonna
get it sorted.

51
00:03:33,514 --> 00:03:34,947
Oh, my God.

52
00:03:37,785 --> 00:03:39,751
- Where are you going?
- Huh?

53
00:03:39,753 --> 00:03:43,655
Moyers, he's making
some kind of announcement.

54
00:03:43,657 --> 00:03:44,890
<i>He asked me to attend.</i>

55
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:48,260
Well, we wouldn't want to upset him,
would we?

56
00:03:48,262 --> 00:03:49,361
Okay.

57
00:03:49,363 --> 00:03:51,597
- What's the problem?
- Uh, how much time do you have?

58
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,732
- Maddie...
- My house is a refugee camp,

59
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:55,667
my daughter's room is an
ICU unit for strangers.

60
00:03:55,669 --> 00:03:58,670
- Someone has to cook, someone has to clean...
- Listen, calm down.

61
00:03:58,672 --> 00:04:00,372
...someone
has to watch Nick.

62
00:04:00,374 --> 00:04:02,374
- Well...
- And that someone, somehow, is me.

63
00:04:02,376 --> 00:04:03,842
'Cause I don't know
where your ex-wife goes.

64
00:04:03,844 --> 00:04:07,546
She's helping sick people.
Is this about Liza?

65
00:04:07,548 --> 00:04:10,282
- What? No, it's about you.
- Me?

66
00:04:10,284 --> 00:04:11,917
Yeah, you run off
to play man of the people...

67
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:13,919
- I'm not playing.
- ...with your soldier friends...

68
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:16,455
- This is not easy.
- ...and I could use a little bit of help here...

69
00:04:16,457 --> 00:04:18,690
Stop. Oh, my God,
just stop it.

70
00:04:18,692 --> 00:04:20,892
This domestic bickering
like it's normal,

71
00:04:20,894 --> 00:04:23,695
like you're normal people
in a normal kitchen.

72
00:04:23,697 --> 00:04:28,300
It's not normal. Stop it.
Stop acting like it is.

73
00:04:31,405 --> 00:04:33,038
You ready to go?

74
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,474
Please.

75
00:04:46,754 --> 00:04:48,287
Do it.

76
00:04:48,289 --> 00:04:50,722
<i>Come on, just do it.</i>

77
00:04:50,724 --> 00:04:52,557
Come on.

78
00:05:01,602 --> 00:05:03,302
Chris, what do you
think you're doing?

79
00:05:03,304 --> 00:05:05,604
- Get down here.
- Dad, you gotta see this.

80
00:05:05,606 --> 00:05:06,638
Chris, now.

81
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,740
I want you
to help Madison, okay?

82
00:05:08,742 --> 00:05:09,875
Okay, just look at this.

83
00:05:09,877 --> 00:05:14,379
- I don't have time for...
- Just five seconds. Look.

84
00:05:17,618 --> 00:05:19,418
There, you see that?

85
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:20,686
See what?
What am I looking at?

86
00:05:20,688 --> 00:05:22,054
It's like a light
or a glint,

87
00:05:22,056 --> 00:05:24,690
but they said there's
nothing alive out there.

88
00:05:24,692 --> 00:05:26,091
Okay, come inside.

89
00:05:26,093 --> 00:05:29,361
- Dad, I think there's someone out there.
- There's no one out there.

90
00:05:29,363 --> 00:05:34,032
It's just the sun's caught
some reflection and...

91
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:38,470
You got to stop,
okay?

92
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:47,579
<i>Come on.</i>

93
00:05:55,589 --> 00:05:58,056
I found this
on the counter.

94
00:05:58,058 --> 00:06:00,892
Oh, yeah,
I guess I forgot.

95
00:06:00,894 --> 00:06:03,061
Oh, you forgot?

96
00:06:03,063 --> 00:06:04,863
Yeah.

97
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:06,832
I guess I did.

98
00:06:06,834 --> 00:06:09,568
- Okay, here it is.
- Oh, no, thanks. I'm good.

99
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:11,403
I don't think
that's the best idea.

100
00:06:11,405 --> 00:06:14,039
<i>Well, I got to kick it.
That's the whole point, right?</i>

101
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:16,441
Nick, come on.

102
00:06:20,914 --> 00:06:22,514
- Nick...
-<i> Look, give it to Griselda.</i>

103
00:06:22,516 --> 00:06:25,484
She needs it more than I do.
You said so yourself.

104
00:06:25,486 --> 00:06:26,451
I know what I said,

105
00:06:26,453 --> 00:06:30,455
but the point is to wean
you off of it slowly.

106
00:06:30,457 --> 00:06:33,458
So it just doesn't,
you know, happen again.

107
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:35,861
I thought you'd be happy.

108
00:06:36,663 --> 00:06:38,563
I am happy,
I just...

109
00:06:41,969 --> 00:06:46,071
Okay, well, if you need it,
it's right here.

110
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:49,708
- Don't be a hero.
- No chance of that.

111
00:06:50,477 --> 00:06:52,844
-<i> Hey, Mom?</i>
- Yeah?

112
00:06:52,846 --> 00:06:54,579
Are you okay?

113
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:57,449
Enjoy your swim.

114
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,154
All right,
listen up here, folks.

115
00:07:03,724 --> 00:07:06,458
As commanding officer
of this detachment,

116
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:09,995
I am proud to announce
that we are infect free

117
00:07:09,997 --> 00:07:13,565
<i>for a six mile radius
around this perimeter.</i>

118
00:07:13,567 --> 00:07:15,767
We are on the offensive.

119
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:18,136
The tide has
most definitely turned.

120
00:07:18,138 --> 00:07:19,738
<i>Yeah.</i>

121
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:23,775
All right,
command asked that I read from the following.

122
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:26,011
"Be advised,
the DZ remains off-limits

123
00:07:26,013 --> 00:07:28,814
while Hazmat teams dispose
of any bio-hazardous material."

124
00:07:28,816 --> 00:07:30,582
Woman:
<i>What bio-hazardous material?</i>

125
00:07:30,584 --> 00:07:32,717
Hey, I'm supposed to read this,
you're supposed to listen, okay?

126
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:34,753
Man:
<i>When will you get the phones up?</i>

127
00:07:34,755 --> 00:07:37,656
"Anyone attempting
to compromise or circumvent

128
00:07:37,658 --> 00:07:39,691
the perimeter of this camp
will be detained."

129
00:07:39,693 --> 00:07:41,159
Man #2:
<i>Are we being relocated?</i>

130
00:07:41,161 --> 00:07:43,762
Sir, this is a secure position,
so, no, you're gonna stay put.

131
00:07:43,764 --> 00:07:46,665
<i>"Curfew will remain in effect
until further notice.</i>

132
00:07:46,667 --> 00:07:48,867
The new health screening
policy will continue.

133
00:07:48,869 --> 00:07:52,170
Sanitation, water treatment,
and other services will return

134
00:07:52,172 --> 00:07:53,805
as we approach
total containment."

135
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:55,841
Sir, we need medicine.
What about that?

136
00:07:55,843 --> 00:07:58,043
We are working on that.
"So keep boiling that water.

137
00:07:58,045 --> 00:08:01,546
You will also find several iodine
tablets in your weekly rations."

138
00:08:01,548 --> 00:08:04,483
Where are the people outside the fence?
Where did you move them?

139
00:08:04,485 --> 00:08:06,051
Crowd:
<i>Where? Where?</i>

140
00:08:06,053 --> 00:08:08,186
All right,
folks, listen.

141
00:08:08,188 --> 00:08:12,691
You are in
one of 12 safe zones

142
00:08:12,693 --> 00:08:15,026
south of
the San Gabriels, okay?

143
00:08:15,028 --> 00:08:16,795
So you guys
are the lucky ones.

144
00:08:16,797 --> 00:08:19,664
You guys... you get
to stay in your homes,

145
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,733
<i>ride this thing out,
all right?</i>

146
00:08:21,735 --> 00:08:26,137
So, relax,
count your blessings, be nice.

147
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:29,508
So I don't have
to shoot you.

148
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:31,042
Yeah.

149
00:08:31,044 --> 00:08:32,911
What's your name, miss?

150
00:08:32,913 --> 00:08:34,045
Uh, Alicia Clark.

151
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:35,747
Oh, Clark.
Yeah, right here.

152
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:40,919
- Hi.
- Hi.

153
00:08:40,921 --> 00:08:43,255
Ofelia Salazar.

154
00:08:43,257 --> 00:08:47,225
Oh, could you
spell that for me?

155
00:08:47,227 --> 00:08:51,129
S-A-L-A...
you're not even looking.

156
00:08:51,131 --> 00:08:53,231
Oh.
Yeah, no, here it is.

157
00:08:53,233 --> 00:08:56,101
Um, Ofelia.

158
00:09:02,009 --> 00:09:04,843
- Mr. Manawa?
- Yes, sir?

159
00:09:04,845 --> 00:09:07,612
Moyers:
<i>A word, please.</i>

160
00:09:07,614 --> 00:09:09,080
Come on.

161
00:09:09,082 --> 00:09:12,284
- Soldier:<i> Have a nice day.</i>
- Ofelia: Yeah, you, too.

162
00:09:12,286 --> 00:09:14,786
Man:<i> Just one case per family, ma'am.
That's how it goes.</i>

163
00:09:14,788 --> 00:09:18,023
Moyers: Guy who lives in this house
with the covered car, Thompson.

164
00:09:18,025 --> 00:09:19,824
- Doug Thompson? Yeah.
- Yeah, okay.

165
00:09:19,826 --> 00:09:21,593
So, he won't
do the screening.

166
00:09:21,595 --> 00:09:22,861
And his wife thinks
for some reason

167
00:09:22,863 --> 00:09:24,996
maybe you could talk
some sense into him.

168
00:09:24,998 --> 00:09:26,831
Well, I don't
really know him.

169
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:30,101
We had a beer once,
and he showed me his car he's rebuilding.

170
00:09:30,103 --> 00:09:31,336
You're a gearhead?

171
00:09:31,338 --> 00:09:33,972
Well, I've kept my father's
Ford going for over 30 years.

172
00:09:33,974 --> 00:09:37,275
Dude, 30 years! That is so great.
Can you help me or no?

173
00:09:37,277 --> 00:09:40,912
- Well, it's just I don't really know the guy.
- Okay.

174
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:44,249
Okay, thing is here is I'm
trying to avoid a situation.

175
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:47,619
<i>So either you're gonna go in
and you're gonna talk him down,</i>

176
00:09:47,621 --> 00:09:50,255
or I'm gonna go in,
I'm gonna take him down.

177
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:53,325
- Yeah or no?
- Okay.

178
00:09:53,327 --> 00:09:56,761
Good.
Gloves on, let's go.

179
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:13,812
How long's
he been in there?

180
00:10:13,814 --> 00:10:15,614
He was acting strange
yesterday,

181
00:10:15,616 --> 00:10:18,617
and then
at dinner he, uh...

182
00:10:18,619 --> 00:10:20,952
Maria, how long?

183
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:23,788
Since then.
Since dinner last night.

184
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,991
The soldiers wanted to talk to him,
but I thought...

185
00:10:25,993 --> 00:10:29,160
I thought it would be better if
it was from someone he knew,

186
00:10:29,162 --> 00:10:31,796
and he's liked you
so much, so...

187
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:43,341
Doug?

188
00:10:46,113 --> 00:10:48,146
Doug?

189
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:54,152
Doug?

190
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:11,302
What's going on?

191
00:11:11,304 --> 00:11:13,371
Hey, Trav.

192
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:17,242
You're worrying
your family, man.

193
00:11:17,244 --> 00:11:18,843
I know that.

194
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:21,913
But I don't...

195
00:11:21,915 --> 00:11:24,683
I don't think
I can do it.

196
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:28,019
Do what?

197
00:11:45,138 --> 00:11:46,404
Take it easy.
Take it easy.

198
00:11:46,406 --> 00:11:47,972
They keep asking me
what's happening.

199
00:11:47,974 --> 00:11:50,709
They keep asking me if
everything's gonna be okay

200
00:11:50,711 --> 00:11:54,345
and I... I don't
have the words.

201
00:11:55,482 --> 00:11:58,850
It is gonna be okay.

202
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:03,154
That's what you say.

203
00:12:04,357 --> 00:12:07,158
That's all
that you have to say.

204
00:12:09,296 --> 00:12:11,930
Will they know
that I'm lying?

205
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:19,337
Doug, your family
needs you.

206
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,773
Now.

207
00:12:21,775 --> 00:12:24,375
They need you
to go outside that door

208
00:12:24,377 --> 00:12:27,078
and tell that guard
that you're gonna be okay.

209
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,414
Show 'em
that you're okay.

210
00:12:31,785 --> 00:12:34,185
That's all.

211
00:12:34,187 --> 00:12:36,988
Yeah.

212
00:14:36,243 --> 00:14:38,643
Hang in there, buddy.

213
00:14:54,928 --> 00:14:57,328
Hey, handsome.

214
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:59,030
I got to go.

215
00:14:59,032 --> 00:15:02,300
You have plenty of juice
for the night, okay?

216
00:15:02,302 --> 00:15:04,335
Mm-hmm.

217
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:08,273
He's stable.

218
00:15:08,275 --> 00:15:09,607
Morphine's helping.

219
00:15:09,609 --> 00:15:12,343
You can't stay?
I made some soup.

220
00:15:12,345 --> 00:15:14,612
Squash from my garden.

221
00:15:14,614 --> 00:15:16,948
I have other people
to check on.

222
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:19,317
Please take some with you.

223
00:15:19,319 --> 00:15:23,054
You must have seen a lot
of people like Hector.

224
00:15:23,056 --> 00:15:25,189
At the hospital?

225
00:15:25,191 --> 00:15:27,125
Yes.

226
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:34,132
Take it.

227
00:15:34,134 --> 00:15:37,502
I don't know what
I would have done.

228
00:15:37,504 --> 00:15:40,305
Hector is all I have.

229
00:15:41,241 --> 00:15:43,308
Thank you.

230
00:15:45,645 --> 00:15:49,480
Woman: <i>Thank you, Liza.
See you tomorrow.</i>

231
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:17,542
- Why show me that?
- Do you see it?

232
00:16:17,544 --> 00:16:19,978
I mean, why not
show your dad?

233
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:22,413
I tried.
He just said it wasn't anything.

234
00:16:22,415 --> 00:16:26,718
Well, maybe he's right.
It could just be a piece of metal or a window

235
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,486
or, you know,
I don't know.

236
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:31,222
Look, there's
a pattern, okay?

237
00:16:31,224 --> 00:16:32,523
Someone's out there.

238
00:16:32,525 --> 00:16:35,093
A human someone,
someone who needs our help.

239
00:16:35,095 --> 00:16:36,094
We don't know that.

240
00:16:36,096 --> 00:16:37,595
What else could it be?
Why else would it just...

241
00:16:37,597 --> 00:16:39,764
If someone needs help,
they go to the soldiers.

242
00:16:39,766 --> 00:16:44,002
Unless they can't.
Or they won't.

243
00:16:46,573 --> 00:16:48,740
Do you see it?

244
00:17:28,281 --> 00:17:31,616
Man on radio: <i>3-2 Echo,
this is Bravo Actual.</i>

245
00:17:31,618 --> 00:17:34,619
<i>Standing by
for a sit-rep, over.</i>

246
00:17:36,356 --> 00:17:38,489
<i>3-2 Echo,
this is Bravo Actual...</i>

247
00:17:38,491 --> 00:17:41,059
Don't you
have to get that?

248
00:17:41,061 --> 00:17:42,360
They'll leave a message.

249
00:17:51,805 --> 00:17:54,839
You're in my head
all day.

250
00:17:54,841 --> 00:17:56,808
I can't concentrate.

251
00:18:07,654 --> 00:18:10,655
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait, wait, wait.

252
00:18:10,657 --> 00:18:13,691
Maybe we should just
slow down a little.

253
00:18:13,693 --> 00:18:15,827
Right.
Yeah, we should.

254
00:18:15,829 --> 00:18:18,596
- I'm sorry. Are you upset?
- No.

255
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:22,133
No, it's okay.
I just...

256
00:18:22,135 --> 00:18:24,402
I like you, Ofelia.
That's all.

257
00:18:24,404 --> 00:18:25,736
Yeah, you're like
the only thing

258
00:18:25,738 --> 00:18:29,273
that makes me believe there's
still good in people.

259
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:32,677
Hey, of course there is.

260
00:18:37,217 --> 00:18:38,850
Hey, um...

261
00:18:38,852 --> 00:18:40,685
did you get the medicine?

262
00:18:40,687 --> 00:18:44,422
I tried.
I asked the corpsman.

263
00:18:44,424 --> 00:18:45,389
What'd he say?

264
00:18:45,391 --> 00:18:47,658
They got it all
locked down tight.

265
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:48,826
I guess they're
stockpiling

266
00:18:48,828 --> 00:18:52,497
for the big push
to take the city back.

267
00:18:52,499 --> 00:18:55,800
It's just, um, my mom's
really sick, so...

268
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:58,736
Yeah, I know that.

269
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:02,173
Man on radio:
<i>3-2 Echo, Interrogative:</i>

270
00:19:02,175 --> 00:19:04,609
-<i> Where the hell is my damn truck?</i> 
- I'm sorry.

271
00:19:04,611 --> 00:19:07,211
<i>Please advise.</i>

272
00:19:07,213 --> 00:19:09,514
Bravo Actual,
this is 3-2 Echo.

273
00:19:09,516 --> 00:19:11,516
Finishing patrol.

274
00:19:11,518 --> 00:19:13,417
Heading back.

275
00:19:27,867 --> 00:19:30,434
Was that make-up sex?

276
00:19:30,436 --> 00:19:32,170
We got to fight more.

277
00:19:36,609 --> 00:19:38,609
Whoo.

278
00:19:41,548 --> 00:19:42,480
Hey.

279
00:19:42,482 --> 00:19:45,917
What's the hurry?
I thought that was nice.

280
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:48,719
- It was.

281
00:19:49,489 --> 00:19:51,222
I got things to do.

282
00:19:51,224 --> 00:19:53,524
Can't it wait?

283
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:55,726
Come here.

284
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:59,530
<i>Come back.</i>

285
00:20:06,272 --> 00:20:07,738
What's going on?

286
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,974
I don't know.

287
00:20:09,976 --> 00:20:12,510
There's no news
from anywhere.

288
00:20:12,512 --> 00:20:13,911
<i>Vivian said
she heard soldiers</i>

289
00:20:13,913 --> 00:20:18,216
talking about quarantine
camps out near Barstow.

290
00:20:19,452 --> 00:20:21,419
I mean, I don't know.

291
00:20:21,421 --> 00:20:22,787
She's a gossip, but...

292
00:20:22,789 --> 00:20:25,790
No, I meant with you.

293
00:20:25,792 --> 00:20:27,425
What's going on with you?

294
00:20:27,427 --> 00:20:31,796
<i>I mean,
you're buzzing around here all day every day,</i>

295
00:20:31,798 --> 00:20:33,998
driving yourself nuts.

296
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,667
I mean, you hover,
clean,

297
00:20:36,669 --> 00:20:39,370
watch Alicia and Nick
like a hawk.

298
00:20:39,372 --> 00:20:41,005
Nick needs
to be watched.

299
00:20:41,007 --> 00:20:43,874
Yeah, I know.
Still.

300
00:20:43,876 --> 00:20:46,277
Well, if we're exchanging
parenting tips,

301
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:48,946
you might want to pay
more attention to Chris.

302
00:20:48,948 --> 00:20:49,814
Oh, okay.

303
00:20:49,816 --> 00:20:52,750
I mean, all I do all day
is pay attention to...

304
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:54,919
Positive attention.

305
00:20:56,823 --> 00:20:58,289
All right.

306
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:03,661
How come I feel like I'm being
called into your office?

307
00:21:04,631 --> 00:21:06,297
Hmm?

308
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,433
I missed you.

309
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:12,703
He showed me the video
he took from the roof.

310
00:21:12,705 --> 00:21:17,275
Jesus, that kid has got a world-class
imagination. You know that.

311
00:21:17,277 --> 00:21:19,010
I saw it, too.

312
00:21:19,012 --> 00:21:22,046
- I did.
- Yeah? Okay.

313
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:26,851
- What did you see?
- I don't know, like a... like a light.

314
00:21:26,853 --> 00:21:29,020
- Mm-hmm.
- Like someone reflecting the sun.

315
00:21:29,022 --> 00:21:31,822
Great.
So you saw a light.

316
00:21:31,824 --> 00:21:33,491
What am I supposed
to do with that?

317
00:21:33,493 --> 00:21:37,595
Go to Moyers and say, what?
"I... my kid saw a light,

318
00:21:37,597 --> 00:21:40,731
so your soldiers, tell them
to drop their duties and..."

319
00:21:40,733 --> 00:21:43,868
That is their duty. It's nine days.
What have they done?

320
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:46,671
They promised
medicine, doctors,

321
00:21:46,673 --> 00:21:48,339
electricity,
information.

322
00:21:48,341 --> 00:21:50,074
Where is it?
What about the phones?

323
00:21:50,076 --> 00:21:52,877
- Don't you wonder why they can't get a landline?
- No, I don't wonder.

324
00:21:52,879 --> 00:21:55,613
- Cell towers? Nothing?
- Maybe they got something bigger to worry about.

325
00:21:55,615 --> 00:21:57,481
Well, maybe they don't
want the phones to work.

326
00:21:57,483 --> 00:22:00,618
Oh, babe, are you listening to yourself?
You're talking paranoid.

327
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:05,523
I don't want to encourage this with Chris,
and you shouldn't either.

328
00:22:06,526 --> 00:22:08,059
So you did see it.

329
00:22:08,061 --> 00:22:10,895
Maria:
<i>Travis! Travis!</i>

330
00:22:10,897 --> 00:22:14,732
-<i> Travis!</i>
- It's Maria.

331
00:22:16,436 --> 00:22:17,601
Maria?

332
00:22:17,603 --> 00:22:20,905
- What are you doing out? It's past curfew.
- They can shoot me.

333
00:22:20,907 --> 00:22:22,440
- What's wrong?
- Doug's gone.

334
00:22:22,442 --> 00:22:24,875
I was in the back of the house with the
girls and I don't know where he went.

335
00:22:24,877 --> 00:22:26,610
All right, calm down, calm down.
Just breathe.

336
00:22:26,612 --> 00:22:28,779
He's missing.
Okay, what did you say to him?

337
00:22:28,781 --> 00:22:31,415
- I didn't say anything.
- He took his car.

338
00:22:31,417 --> 00:22:33,651
He took his stupid,
precious car and I don't know where he went.

339
00:22:33,653 --> 00:22:35,920
- Okay, let's take the girls inside.
- No, they stay with me.

340
00:22:35,922 --> 00:22:38,689
Look, I'm sure he's fine. He's just
clearing his head somewhere, that's all.

341
00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:41,859
We're not allowed to drive inside the fence,
Travis. It's not allowed.

342
00:22:41,861 --> 00:22:43,394
I know, I know.
I understand.

343
00:22:43,396 --> 00:22:45,396
So what... what if he...
oh, my God.

344
00:22:45,398 --> 00:22:47,365
No, look, just don't go there,
please, all right?

345
00:22:47,367 --> 00:22:51,068
I'm gonna find him.
I'll find your dad, all right?

346
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:55,673
We'll find him, yeah?
Come on, I'll walk you home.

347
00:23:32,445 --> 00:23:34,478
Shit.

348
00:24:05,645 --> 00:24:07,878
Ah, Christ.
I hooked it.

349
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:10,114
Travis:
<i>His wife's worried he went over.</i>

350
00:24:10,116 --> 00:24:12,483
I'm just asking that you
send out one patrol.

351
00:24:12,485 --> 00:24:15,152
- He hasn't been missing long.
- He's not missing.

352
00:24:15,154 --> 00:24:16,887
We pulled Doug Thompson
last night.

353
00:24:16,889 --> 00:24:18,189
<i>Found him
up by the fence</i>

354
00:24:18,191 --> 00:24:20,991
<i>bawling his eyes out
in his damn muscle car.</i>

355
00:24:20,993 --> 00:24:25,663
That guy, man, he is...
he's a head case.

356
00:24:25,665 --> 00:24:28,632
Can't have that
around camp.

357
00:24:28,634 --> 00:24:30,701
God damn it!

358
00:24:31,537 --> 00:24:32,970
Don't look at me
like that.

359
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:35,906
It's not my order, though I agree with it.
You should, too.

360
00:24:35,908 --> 00:24:37,975
<i>You talked to the guy,
didn't you?</i>

361
00:24:37,977 --> 00:24:40,077
He seem okay to you?

362
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:42,613
- No.
-<i> No.</i>

363
00:24:42,615 --> 00:24:43,747
So what are we
talking about?

364
00:24:43,749 --> 00:24:46,083
Thompson gets the help
he so desperately needs

365
00:24:46,085 --> 00:24:47,218
back at headquarters,

366
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:51,822
I don't have to worry about some
guy going psycho inside the fence.

367
00:24:51,824 --> 00:24:52,823
That's a win-win.

368
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:55,192
You could've notified
his wife, sir.

369
00:24:55,194 --> 00:24:57,561
I'm not a social worker.

370
00:24:57,563 --> 00:24:58,863
That's your job,
Mr. Mayor.

371
00:24:58,865 --> 00:25:02,700
<i>Now, you go ahead
and notify away.</i>

372
00:25:04,103 --> 00:25:06,670
What?

373
00:25:06,672 --> 00:25:10,207
My son, he saw a light
in the DZ

374
00:25:10,209 --> 00:25:12,610
<i>up on the hillside.</i>

375
00:25:12,612 --> 00:25:15,913
There's nothing alive out there.
He didn't see anything.

376
00:25:16,949 --> 00:25:21,652
We, uh...
we went house to house, block by block.

377
00:25:21,654 --> 00:25:23,153
I know.

378
00:25:23,155 --> 00:25:26,590
- Forget it.
- Already did.

379
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:30,995
Oh, that's money.

380
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:42,940
Cynthia?

381
00:25:45,077 --> 00:25:46,744
Cynthia?

382
00:25:53,319 --> 00:25:56,253
Liza, there you are.

383
00:25:56,255 --> 00:25:58,055
Where's Hector?

384
00:25:58,057 --> 00:26:00,257
Getting the care he needs.

385
00:26:00,259 --> 00:26:02,126
Who are you?

386
00:26:02,128 --> 00:26:03,627
I'm Dr. Exner.

387
00:26:03,629 --> 00:26:05,262
Cynthia:
<i>She's from the government.</i>

388
00:26:05,264 --> 00:26:07,831
Cynthia's told me
all about you.

389
00:26:07,833 --> 00:26:09,600
Oh.

390
00:26:09,602 --> 00:26:10,801
What did she tell you?

391
00:26:10,803 --> 00:26:13,270
That you're the reason
why her husband's alive.

392
00:26:13,272 --> 00:26:14,772
That you're
a very good nurse.

393
00:26:14,774 --> 00:26:16,140
Cynthia:
<i>Nurse practitioner.</i>

394
00:26:16,142 --> 00:26:18,943
That's basically
a doctor.

395
00:26:20,313 --> 00:26:22,012
Where did you
take Hector?

396
00:26:22,014 --> 00:26:23,714
Sit down.

397
00:26:23,716 --> 00:26:26,116
I want to see him.

398
00:26:26,118 --> 00:26:29,053
Cynthia was kind enough
to show me this chart,

399
00:26:29,055 --> 00:26:31,622
and I'll admit I'm not
familiar with some of these...

400
00:26:31,624 --> 00:26:33,257
Look, I should
explain this to you...

401
00:26:33,259 --> 00:26:36,060
Cynthia,
do you mind if Liza and I speak privately?

402
00:26:36,062 --> 00:26:37,628
<i>Oh, no, no, no.</i>

403
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:39,196
<i>That's great.
Of course.</i>

404
00:26:39,198 --> 00:26:43,867
I should get
packed anyways.

405
00:26:43,869 --> 00:26:47,004
Liza, you're an angel.

406
00:26:47,006 --> 00:26:49,373
Oh...

407
00:26:54,981 --> 00:26:56,380
Where's she going?

408
00:26:56,382 --> 00:26:59,817
She wanted to be
with her husband.

409
00:26:59,819 --> 00:27:00,985
Where is that?

410
00:27:00,987 --> 00:27:04,755
You used a morphine drip.
Unorthodox.

411
00:27:04,757 --> 00:27:09,193
I, uh... I didn't have
any nitrates,

412
00:27:09,195 --> 00:27:11,795
so I had to salvage
from another neighbor.

413
00:27:11,797 --> 00:27:15,299
I needed to find a way to get
the pressure off of his heart.

414
00:27:15,301 --> 00:27:16,967
What about
your other patients?

415
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:18,402
I've already
met four people

416
00:27:18,404 --> 00:27:21,105
that swear you're the
reason they're alive.

417
00:27:21,107 --> 00:27:23,807
I'm just making them
comfortable.

418
00:27:23,809 --> 00:27:25,909
Hector's
the only crit case.

419
00:27:25,911 --> 00:27:31,815
Well, you did very well,
considering you're not actually a nurse.

420
00:27:31,817 --> 00:27:33,984
Are you?

421
00:27:40,826 --> 00:27:44,762
He was gonna die.
I didn't know what else to do.

422
00:27:44,764 --> 00:27:47,231
I needed to get her
to trust me

423
00:27:47,233 --> 00:27:49,366
so that she could
let me...

424
00:27:49,368 --> 00:27:50,668
so that I can help.

425
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:53,704
It's all right.
Desperate times.

426
00:27:56,008 --> 00:28:00,110
Perhaps you'd be willing
to pretend a little longer?

427
00:28:00,112 --> 00:28:02,980
Excuse me?

428
00:29:46,318 --> 00:29:48,085
Oh!

429
00:30:30,996 --> 00:30:32,963
Ah!

430
00:31:18,644 --> 00:31:20,577
It was under control.

431
00:31:20,579 --> 00:31:21,445
I drained it.

432
00:31:21,447 --> 00:31:24,081
We change the dressing
twice a day.

433
00:31:24,083 --> 00:31:26,550
No antibiotics,
this was always the outcome.

434
00:31:26,552 --> 00:31:28,452
It's not
anything you did.

435
00:31:28,454 --> 00:31:29,987
We're gonna
take care of you.

436
00:31:34,193 --> 00:31:38,061
- How are you gonna do this?
- We have a facility nearby.

437
00:31:38,063 --> 00:31:41,431
- Military facility?
- It's military now, fortified.

438
00:31:41,433 --> 00:31:45,302
We have beds, surgeons,
which, I'm afraid,

439
00:31:45,304 --> 00:31:47,604
is what your wife's
injury requires.

440
00:31:49,475 --> 00:31:53,944
My wife would like to know
how far this place is.

441
00:31:53,946 --> 00:31:55,312
Close, 15 minutes.

442
00:31:55,314 --> 00:31:57,915
Not a lot of traffic
these days.

443
00:31:58,517 --> 00:32:00,050
I'm going with her.

444
00:32:00,052 --> 00:32:02,920
Of course.
She's your wife.

445
00:32:07,393 --> 00:32:09,293
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

446
00:32:12,264 --> 00:32:16,133
- No, no, no, no, no.

447
00:32:19,705 --> 00:32:23,140
No, no, no, no.

448
00:32:30,349 --> 00:32:31,982
Nick?

449
00:32:32,651 --> 00:32:34,651
- Nick.
- What?

450
00:32:34,653 --> 00:32:37,087
This is Dr. Exner.

451
00:32:38,524 --> 00:32:40,724
Hi.

452
00:32:40,726 --> 00:32:44,127
I understand you may
be in need of methadone.

453
00:32:44,997 --> 00:32:46,630
Well, I would
love methadone

454
00:32:46,632 --> 00:32:51,201
if I was trying to kick,
which I've already done.

455
00:32:51,203 --> 00:32:53,303
<i>When's the last time
you used?</i>

456
00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:56,540
Uh, I don't know.
When did the world end?

457
00:32:56,542 --> 00:32:59,142
Couple of days
before that.

458
00:33:02,147 --> 00:33:03,013
What's this?

459
00:33:03,015 --> 00:33:06,416
Overdue house calls.
I'm Dr. Exner.

460
00:33:06,418 --> 00:33:07,484
Oh, Travis.

461
00:33:07,486 --> 00:33:09,686
Can't tell you how happy
we are to see you.

462
00:33:09,688 --> 00:33:12,255
Um, is something
wrong with Nick?

463
00:33:12,257 --> 00:33:13,290
Nick:
<i>No, I'm fine.</i>

464
00:33:13,292 --> 00:33:15,692
But your ex-wife,
man, she's a NARC.

465
00:33:15,694 --> 00:33:19,463
Told this lady I was the
neighborhood dope fiend.

466
00:33:20,532 --> 00:33:24,534
98.6. I'm gonna check
your blood pressure.

467
00:33:24,536 --> 00:33:28,438
So are you the one that decides
who goes to this facility?

468
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:31,641
Exner: <i>Well,
I have some help, but, yes.</i>

469
00:33:31,643 --> 00:33:32,776
Like Doug Thompson?

470
00:33:32,778 --> 00:33:34,444
I can't discuss
other patients.

471
00:33:34,446 --> 00:33:38,548
Liza: <i>Excuse him.
He worries about everyone else.</i>

472
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:40,250
Your friend
is in good hands.

473
00:33:40,252 --> 00:33:41,451
Just like Hector Ramirez.

474
00:33:41,453 --> 00:33:44,588
<i>Just like
Griselda will be.</i>

475
00:33:45,424 --> 00:33:48,025
You okay, Nick?

476
00:33:48,027 --> 00:33:49,326
Yeah.

477
00:33:49,328 --> 00:33:51,228
Uh, yeah, yeah.

478
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:53,096
Is Mr. Ramirez okay?

479
00:33:53,098 --> 00:33:55,799
Congestive heart disease
is manageable.

480
00:33:58,604 --> 00:34:01,071
Your heart rate's
elevated.

481
00:34:01,073 --> 00:34:04,374
You're a very
attractive woman.

482
00:34:28,133 --> 00:34:30,300
Daniel:
<i>Where did you go?</i>

483
00:34:30,302 --> 00:34:33,503
Madison:
<i>Outside the fence.</i>

484
00:34:33,505 --> 00:34:35,539
What did you see?

485
00:34:42,481 --> 00:34:44,748
- Madison: Who is that?
- Daniel:<i> That's the doctor.</i>

486
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:48,385
She wants to take my wife
and do surgery on her.

487
00:34:48,387 --> 00:34:51,221
Well, that's good.

488
00:34:52,691 --> 00:34:55,092
Tell me what you saw.

489
00:35:01,366 --> 00:35:03,333
Bodies.

490
00:35:04,403 --> 00:35:06,603
Yes.

491
00:35:06,605 --> 00:35:08,605
The infected.

492
00:35:08,607 --> 00:35:10,373
But...

493
00:35:10,375 --> 00:35:12,809
Go on.

494
00:35:12,811 --> 00:35:14,811
There was a man

495
00:35:14,813 --> 00:35:18,281
shot like the others,
like the rest,

496
00:35:18,283 --> 00:35:21,218
but he... he wasn't sick.

497
00:35:21,687 --> 00:35:25,222
And there were others
like that.

498
00:35:31,563 --> 00:35:34,865
When I was young,

499
00:35:34,867 --> 00:35:36,833
these men...

500
00:35:36,835 --> 00:35:38,835
these men were
from the government.

501
00:35:38,837 --> 00:35:40,237
They came to our town

502
00:35:40,239 --> 00:35:42,873
and they took
some people away.

503
00:35:42,875 --> 00:35:46,176
And my father
was someone

504
00:35:46,178 --> 00:35:47,777
of certain importance
in the community,

505
00:35:47,779 --> 00:35:50,714
so he went to speak
to the captain

506
00:35:50,716 --> 00:35:54,217
and asked,
"When will they return?"

507
00:35:54,853 --> 00:35:56,586
And the captain
told my father,

508
00:35:56,588 --> 00:35:59,322
"Miguel, don't worry.

509
00:35:59,324 --> 00:36:02,159
They always come home."

510
00:36:03,695 --> 00:36:05,929
And they did.

511
00:36:07,266 --> 00:36:11,735
I was standing
in the river fishing.

512
00:36:11,737 --> 00:36:13,436
Just a boy.

513
00:36:13,438 --> 00:36:16,406
And I found them.

514
00:36:16,408 --> 00:36:19,843
All of them.
All at once.

515
00:36:19,845 --> 00:36:21,678
All around me.

516
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,914
In the water.

517
00:36:25,284 --> 00:36:30,353
My father told me not to
have hatred in my heart.

518
00:36:30,355 --> 00:36:33,190
He said that men
do these things

519
00:36:33,192 --> 00:36:35,625
not because of evil.

520
00:36:35,627 --> 00:36:39,596
They do evil
because of fear.

521
00:36:39,598 --> 00:36:44,534
And at that moment,
I realized my father is a fool

522
00:36:44,536 --> 00:36:48,338
for believing
there was a difference.

523
00:36:48,707 --> 00:36:53,743
If it happens,
it will happen quickly

524
00:36:53,745 --> 00:36:55,445
and you must
be prepared.

525
00:36:55,447 --> 00:36:58,715
Yeah, if what...
what happens?

526
00:36:58,717 --> 00:36:59,983
I must go with my wife.

527
00:36:59,985 --> 00:37:04,854
If I don't return,
you will look after Ofelia for me.

528
00:37:04,856 --> 00:37:06,957
She's a grown woman.
She doesn't need...

529
00:37:06,959 --> 00:37:07,891
Please.

530
00:37:07,893 --> 00:37:13,296
You will look after
Ofelia for me, please.

531
00:37:17,669 --> 00:37:19,836
Thank you.

532
00:37:30,415 --> 00:37:32,916
Keep your son close.

533
00:38:24,303 --> 00:38:26,736
What do you
want me to say?

534
00:38:33,478 --> 00:38:35,512
You don't know.

535
00:38:35,514 --> 00:38:37,447
What?

536
00:38:41,853 --> 00:38:47,357
You have no idea.

537
00:39:11,783 --> 00:39:13,450
Go away.
You gotta leave.

538
00:39:13,452 --> 00:39:14,851
What the hell happened
to your face?

539
00:39:14,853 --> 00:39:16,486
Knock, for Christ's sake.
Go away!

540
00:39:16,488 --> 00:39:18,588
Stop, Nick, let me
just have a look at it.

541
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:19,756
Nick!

542
00:39:19,758 --> 00:39:21,825
-<i> Let me in.</i>
- What's going on?

543
00:39:21,827 --> 00:39:22,926
<i>Let me in.</i>

544
00:39:22,928 --> 00:39:25,829
Nick. What happened?

545
00:39:25,831 --> 00:39:29,632
Travis, stop, look.
Let me just...

546
00:39:30,369 --> 00:39:32,068
I got it, okay?

547
00:39:33,438 --> 00:39:35,472
Okay.

548
00:39:38,844 --> 00:39:42,045
Alicia:
<i>Nick, he's gone.</i>

549
00:39:42,047 --> 00:39:43,680
<i>Come on, let me in.</i>

550
00:39:46,551 --> 00:39:49,085
Do you want me
to get Mom?

551
00:40:03,735 --> 00:40:06,536
Who did that to you?

552
00:40:06,538 --> 00:40:09,639
- Are you okay?
-<i> Mm-hmm.</i>

553
00:40:09,641 --> 00:40:12,409
You want to talk
about it?

554
00:40:12,411 --> 00:40:14,577
Hey, hey, it's okay.

555
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:15,879
It's okay.

556
00:40:25,657 --> 00:40:27,824
It's okay.

557
00:41:02,194 --> 00:41:03,626
Liza:
<i>All right.</i>

558
00:41:03,628 --> 00:41:05,161
<i>This is good,
this is good.</i>

559
00:41:05,163 --> 00:41:07,464
Okay, come on.
All right.

560
00:41:07,466 --> 00:41:09,466
- Careful.
- Soldier:<i> Okay, let's go.</i>

561
00:41:10,869 --> 00:41:14,170
- Liza:<i> Gentle.</i> 
- Hey, I don't know how long we will be.

562
00:41:14,172 --> 00:41:17,574
- Soldier:<i> Let's go to your right.</i> 
- Okay.

563
00:41:17,576 --> 00:41:19,209
What the hell
is going on?

564
00:41:19,211 --> 00:41:22,045
- Liza: Gentle.
- Hey. Whoa, hey, hey. What's all this?

565
00:41:22,047 --> 00:41:25,181
If we don't get Griselda to the surgeon,
she's gonna lose the foot.

566
00:41:25,183 --> 00:41:26,983
- You're in the way.
- All right, okay.

567
00:41:26,985 --> 00:41:29,552
<i>All right, step. Good.</i>

568
00:41:29,554 --> 00:41:31,221
- Soldier: <i>Here we go. Lead on.</i> 
- Liza:<i> Okay.</i>

569
00:41:31,223 --> 00:41:33,156
- Sir, I'll need you to wait.
- Liza:<i> All right...</i>

570
00:41:33,158 --> 00:41:34,657
No, that's okay.
That's his wife.

571
00:41:34,659 --> 00:41:37,760
Come on, come on.

572
00:41:37,762 --> 00:41:38,728
I have two names.

573
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:41,631
Griselda Salazar,
Daniel Salazar.

574
00:41:41,633 --> 00:41:42,899
No, not you.

575
00:41:42,901 --> 00:41:44,667
- Nicolas Clark.
- What?

576
00:41:44,669 --> 00:41:48,805
<i>Come on, man.
Free medical, care of the US Military.</i>

577
00:41:48,807 --> 00:41:49,939
Run.

578
00:41:49,941 --> 00:41:51,608
- Travis: <i>Whoa, whoa, whoa.</i> 
- Hey!

579
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:53,209
That's a mistake.
No, no, that's a mistake.

580
00:41:53,211 --> 00:41:55,912
- That's a mistake. Nick...
- Alicia:<i> Wait. Hey! Hold on!</i>

581
00:41:55,914 --> 00:41:58,214
- Madison:<i> No, no, no!</i> 
- Take it easy. Take it easy.

582
00:41:58,216 --> 00:41:59,949
- Back off, sir.
- Don't you hurt him.

583
00:41:59,951 --> 00:42:02,151
Stand down.
Stand down, ma'am.

584
00:42:02,153 --> 00:42:03,653
- Madison:<i> Nick!</i>
- Come on.

585
00:42:03,655 --> 00:42:06,823
- No, he's not sick.
- Calm down, ma'am.

586
00:42:11,563 --> 00:42:15,231
Hey, hey, hey! Hey!

587
00:42:15,233 --> 00:42:16,566
Travis:
<i>Easy!</i>

588
00:42:16,568 --> 00:42:17,667
- Dad!
- Take it easy.

589
00:42:17,669 --> 00:42:19,202
- Soldier: Step back.
- What are you doing?

590
00:42:19,204 --> 00:42:20,870
Take it easy, man!
He's a kid!

591
00:42:20,872 --> 00:42:21,905
It's an old man
and a kid.

592
00:42:21,907 --> 00:42:23,673
What are you doing?
This is our home.

593
00:42:23,675 --> 00:42:26,009
Hey, I didn't
do anything, man.

594
00:42:26,578 --> 00:42:28,678
I didn't do anything.

595
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:31,247
Let Nick stay.
He's not a risk.

596
00:42:31,249 --> 00:42:32,916
I'll look after him.
Please.

597
00:42:32,918 --> 00:42:34,584
- You said you wanted to help.
- Yeah.

598
00:42:34,586 --> 00:42:36,920
- I do, yes, but...
- Then get in the truck.

599
00:42:36,922 --> 00:42:38,755
We could use you
in the hospital.

600
00:42:38,757 --> 00:42:41,691
He knows me, please.
Just let me talk to Moyers.

601
00:42:41,693 --> 00:42:42,725
It doesn't matter.

602
00:42:42,727 --> 00:42:45,128
Travis:
<i>Would you just let me talk to Moyers?</i>

603
00:42:45,130 --> 00:42:47,096
No.

604
00:42:48,967 --> 00:42:51,634
No! No, Nick!

605
00:42:54,973 --> 00:42:56,606
Soldier:
<i>We're set!</i>

606
00:42:56,608 --> 00:42:59,709
Soldier #2:
<i>Convoy's moving out!</i>

607
00:43:00,779 --> 00:43:02,078
I have a son.
He needs me.

608
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:05,281
We'll come back for your son.
He's safe here for now.

609
00:43:05,283 --> 00:43:08,985
But Griselda, the others,
they need you.

610
00:43:08,987 --> 00:43:11,120
I need you.

611
00:43:12,791 --> 00:43:14,190
You coming?

612
00:43:14,192 --> 00:43:17,293
- Soldier:<i> Let's go!</i> 
- Soldier #2:<i> What's the hold-up?</i>

613
00:43:17,295 --> 00:43:18,895
Exner:
<i>Liza.</i>

614
00:43:18,897 --> 00:43:22,865
Soldier:<i> Get her up.
Come on, lady.</i>

615
00:43:24,035 --> 00:43:27,837
Soldier #2: <i>Come on, lady.
Are you coming or not?</i>

616
00:43:28,907 --> 00:43:29,739
Mom?

617
00:43:29,741 --> 00:43:31,941
Don't worry.

618
00:43:31,943 --> 00:43:34,344
All right, clear out.

619
00:43:36,681 --> 00:43:38,681
Chris:
<i>Mom.</i>

620
00:43:40,852 --> 00:43:43,620
Where is he?
Where did you take him?

621
00:43:43,622 --> 00:43:46,322
Where is he?
No... Nick!

622
00:44:13,652 --> 00:44:14,884
Chris?

623
00:44:23,895 --> 00:44:25,795
Liza.

624
00:44:25,797 --> 00:44:27,697
She did this.

625
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:59,829
Alicia's voice:
<i>"Patrick, if you find this,</i>

626
00:44:59,831 --> 00:45:02,432
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

627
00:45:02,434 --> 00:45:06,169
<i>If you find this,
I love you.</i>

628
00:45:08,039 --> 00:45:12,108
<i>I saw something today,
something that horrified me.</i>

629
00:45:12,110 --> 00:45:15,011
<i>At first, I thought
it was unnatural.</i>

630
00:45:15,013 --> 00:45:17,714
<i>I thought
it was an aberration.</i>

631
00:45:17,716 --> 00:45:19,415
<i>But I was wrong.</i>

632
00:45:19,417 --> 00:45:22,218
<i>What I saw
was prophesized.</i>

633
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:24,754
<i>What I saw was godly.</i>

634
00:45:24,756 --> 00:45:26,923
<i>And I think it's overdue.</i>

635
00:45:26,925 --> 00:45:31,227
<i>I wish you were here,
but I will see you soon.</i>

636
00:45:31,229 --> 00:45:33,496
<i>And you will hold me."</i>

637
00:45:42,207 --> 00:45:46,342
Alicia's voice:
<i>"If you find this, I am sorry."</i>

638
00:45:48,513 --> 00:45:52,915
Alicia's voice:
<i>"If you find this, I love you."</i>
