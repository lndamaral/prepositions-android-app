00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,500
The Reincarnation of Sex

2
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,750
- You have a beautiful body.
- You too.

3
00:03:10,001 --> 00:03:14,500
- Speak quietly.
- They are heavy sleepers.

4
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,250
Scares me.

5
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,700
Ok.

6
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:14,450
This makes it easy.

7
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,200

8
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:04,000
- You knew.
- Leave them.

9
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,750
Don't go there, don't go.

10
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,500
My daughter...

11
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:15,250
...with an employee!

12
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I'll kill them.

13
00:05:29,259 --> 00:05:30,750
They have their rights!

14
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,800
Rights?

15
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:34,550
I'll not let you go there.

16
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,900
- They have the right to do so?
- Yes.

17
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:07,850
And us?

18
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,600
And me?

19
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:04,351
Hi.

20
00:07:05,901 --> 00:07:08,101
Let me help you.

21
00:07:13,001 --> 00:07:14,251
Then?

22
00:07:14,991 --> 00:07:16,901
Her monthly bleeding has come?

23
00:07:19,151 --> 00:07:20,651
Here now.

24
00:07:25,201 --> 00:07:27,701
Do you lie to defend this girl?

25
00:07:27,951 --> 00:07:29,951
...what she wants and do.

26
00:07:30,301 --> 00:07:31,701
...is law for you.

27
00:07:32,951 --> 00:07:35,451
But we that know what is better for her.

28
00:07:35,701 --> 00:07:40,801
She's not pregnant, if this
is what you want to know.

29
00:08:14,051 --> 00:08:17,551
Lia. I want to talk to you.

30
00:08:17,801 --> 00:08:19,301
Yes?

31
00:08:20,551 --> 00:08:25,050
Do not need to serve
the lunch to Arthur.

32
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:28,210
I told him to go to
the city buy some tools.

33
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:29,990
He'll eat something over there.

34
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,740
Are you sure?

35
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:35,491
Yes.

36
00:09:17,741 --> 00:09:20,241
Mom, what's happening with daddy?

37
00:09:20,491 --> 00:09:21,991
Nothing!

38
00:09:22,241 --> 00:09:24,741
Is something about Arthur?

39
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:26,492
No.

40
00:09:41,742 --> 00:09:43,242
Come in.

41
00:09:44,492 --> 00:09:47,992
I take you there.

42
00:09:50,242 --> 00:09:53,742
Thank you Mr. Antonio.

43
00:10:27,992 --> 00:10:31,492
Come with me.

44
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:02,242
What do you want Mr. Antonio?

45
00:11:02,992 --> 00:11:09,992
I was thinking... you're my employee,
Patricia is my daughter and you sleep together.

46
00:11:10,242 --> 00:11:12,742
I have the right to know.

47
00:11:12,992 --> 00:11:15,492
Do you love each other?

48
00:11:16,742 --> 00:11:18,843
Yes.

49
00:11:19,093 --> 00:11:26,593
I know this story... money differences
disappear when is true love.

50
00:11:26,999 --> 00:11:29,943
And your love is like this.

51
00:11:30,193 --> 00:11:33,693
Yes, you don't are cheating.

52
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:39,443
We was waiting for a better time
to explain to you Mr. Antonio.

53
00:12:19,693 --> 00:12:21,193
I had to do it!

54
00:12:21,443 --> 00:12:23,943
I could not allow.

55
00:12:24,193 --> 00:12:28,693
He crossed the line.

56
00:12:42,943 --> 00:12:44,443
Daddy?

57
00:12:44,693 --> 00:12:47,194
Is Arthur alright?

58
00:12:47,444 --> 00:12:49,944
He's taking too long.

59
00:12:50,194 --> 00:12:53,694
Maybe he has decided to
not come back anymore.

60
00:12:53,944 --> 00:12:56,444
He was with your father's
money to shopping.

61
00:12:56,694 --> 00:13:00,194
He can stay in the city
or travel to another place.

62
00:13:00,444 --> 00:13:03,944
Maybe he had found a
girlfriend over there.

63
00:14:12,194 --> 00:14:14,694
Patricia?

64
00:14:15,944 --> 00:14:18,444
Yes.

65
00:14:18,694 --> 00:14:20,195
Is too late now.

66
00:14:20,445 --> 00:14:22,946
Your father wants to close here.

67
00:14:40,996 --> 00:14:42,696
Daddy?

68
00:14:52,946 --> 00:14:54,446
You are thinking on Arthur.

69
00:14:55,696 --> 00:14:57,196
Sorry.

70
00:14:57,446 --> 00:14:58,946
He's a betrayer.

71
00:14:59,197 --> 00:15:05,699
I gave him everything, home, food,
my friendship, payment for his work.

72
00:15:05,949 --> 00:15:07,949
He abandoned me!

73
00:15:10,199 --> 00:15:13,200
I was already suspicious.

74
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:16,950
He was only waiting an opportunity

75
00:15:17,201 --> 00:15:20,701
I put money on his hand and he left me.

76
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:28,452
Now i do not want listen nothing
about him in this house anymore.

77
00:15:28,702 --> 00:15:32,202
Your mother is alright, he
is certainly with some woman.

78
00:15:32,452 --> 00:15:34,952
Forget this guy

79
00:15:38,443 --> 00:15:42,803
Patricia.

80
00:15:45,053 --> 00:15:46,553
Patricia.

81
00:15:54,803 --> 00:15:57,303
Come Patricia.

82
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:37,053
Your father Patricia.

83
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:42,803
He killed me.

84
00:17:43,053 --> 00:17:46,553
With an ax.

85
00:18:51,803 --> 00:18:58,303
I wish i could have your
whole body, but i can't.

86
00:20:01,553 --> 00:20:05,153
How did she knows about everything?

87
00:20:05,509 --> 00:20:07,903
I didn't tell you where.

88
00:20:37,153 --> 00:20:40,653
Why?

89
00:20:57,903 --> 00:21:01,403
You can't drink so much.

90
00:21:42,653 --> 00:21:44,153
Patricia.

91
00:21:50,403 --> 00:21:52,903
Patricia.

92
00:22:35,153 --> 00:22:38,653
Ten years later.

93
00:22:46,903 --> 00:22:50,704

00:22:51,054 --> 00:22:53,354

101
00:23:13,202 --> 00:23:15,702
The house is a palace.

102
00:23:36,952 --> 00:23:38,552

103
00:23:39,802 --> 00:23:41,802

00:26:07,461 --> 00:26:12,961
Celia, I'm tired.

115
00:26:15,211 --> 00:26:20,711
I think sex is the best
thing in the world, you know.

116
00:26:20,961 --> 00:26:24,462
But i have my limits, i'm tired

118
00:26:26,462 --> 00:26:32,962
Sorry? I came three times, you five and
you're not satisfied yet. It's enough for me.

119
00:26:33,212 --> 00:26:36,712
Ok, i'll not force you anymore.

120
00:26:36,962 --> 00:26:39,462
I worked all day my love.

Allright, i'll control myself.

122
00:26:45,462 --> 00:26:47,962
Is a nice house.

123
00:26:49,212 --> 00:26:52,712
I couldn't choose a bad estate agent.

124
00:26:53,962 --> 00:26:56,462
I knew that i could trust on you.

125
00:27:44,712 --> 00:27:46,212
Celia.

What do you want Mr. Antonio?

137

138
00:29:29,461 --> 00:29:30,961
Stop the car.

139

You look nervous, i

00:30:08,461 --> 00:30:10,561
I'm not needing a psychiatrist.

143
00:30:11,211 --> 00:30:15,311
Roberto is your uncle and a
excellent doctor, he can help you.

144
00:30:15,561 --> 00:30:19,061
I do not have any problem,
i'm ok. I'm not going crazy.

145
00:30:19,311 --> 00:30:23,811
I'm just worried. Don't be worried.

146
00:30:26,061 --> 00:30:27,561

00:32:51,474 --> 00:32:53,975
Hello Roberto? Is Fabio.

155
00:32:54,225 --> 00:33:01,025
Listen me and do not talk. The honeymoon?
Is nice. the new house is wonderful.

156
00:33:01,275 --> 00:33:03,775
Everything is alright, but Celia...

157
00:33:04,025 --> 00:33:05,525
What's happening?

158
00:33:05,975 --> 00:33:08,375
She has being weird.

159
00:33:08,625 --> 00:33:15,125
Another day she gone into the bush like a robot,
hypnotized. Looking for something that only she could see

160
00:33:15,375 --> 00:33:21,875
having high sex drive, anxiety
and dificulty breathing.

161
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:24,625
Now she wants sex all the time.

162
00:33:24,875 --> 00:33:27,375
Is a hysterical and sick behavior

163
00:33:27,625 --> 00:33:30,125
I want that you come to visit us.

164
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:32,875
Ok Fabio.

167
00:33:40,625 --> 00:33:48,225
I feel her heart beating abnormally when we have
sex, I try to stop but she always wants more and more.

168
00:33:48,475 --> 00:33:53,075
And never be sastisfied. Another day i felt that

I listened everything.
You don't need to hide.

173
00:34:05,345 --> 00:34:08,799
You're wrong saying i'll stab you.

174
00:34:09,049 --> 00:34:17,549
Now he'll come here to hear me and give me medicine. But he could
be here to do another thing... Doesn't matter he is my relative.

175
00:34:17,799 --> 00:34:21,299

00:36:50,699 --> 00:36:52,699
Are you there?

186
00:38:20,949 --> 00:38:22,449
Go away.

187
00:38:34,699 --> 00:38:36,199
Mr. Antonio.

188
00:38:36,449 --> 00:38:40,949
Only now i found a tenant to your house.

189
00:38:41,199 --> 00:38:43,999
She don't know about the tragedy
that occurred in the house.

190
00:38:44,249 --> 00:38:50,749
She is a weird woman but
the family pay for the rent

191
00:38:50,999 --> 00:38:53,599
I hope you understand that
wasn't possible to find a couple.

192
00:38:53,849 --> 00:38:59,949
But we know our new tenant will not be without
man in that lonely place for too much time.

193
00:39:00,899 --> 00:39:04,199
The house was rented for a good price.

194
00:39:35,949 --> 00:39:38,249
Ligia.

195
00:39:40,499 --> 00:39:41,999
Ligia.

196
00:39:44,249 --> 00:39:46,749
Ligia.

197
00:39:50,999 --> 00:39:53,499
You're so lonely.

198
00:39:54,949 --> 00:39:58,949
You need love.

199
00:39:59,999 --> 00:40:05,499
The road Lidia. The road.

200
00:40:11,749 --> 00:40:17,249
A man, Ligia a man to love.

201
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:23,998
Any man Ligia, anyone.

202
00:40:43,248 --> 00:40:47,748
- You'll not regret.
- I can't be here too long.

203
00:40:47,998 --> 00:40:49,499
You'll want to stay.

204
00:40:49,749 --> 00:40:53,269
I have to deliver a shipment
in the city tomorrow morning.

205
00:40:53,519 --> 00:40:58,329
We'll fuck just once,
very fast, and i 'll go ok?

206
00:40:58,579 --> 00:41:00,069
Don't speak.

207
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:02,819
Wait and you'll see.

208
00:41:03,069 --> 00:41:04,569
What a big house!

209
00:41:04,819 --> 00:41:06,319
Do you like it?

210
00:41:06,569 --> 00:41:08,269
Cool.

211
00:41:26,519 --> 00:41:28,019
Come on let's go.

212
00:41:28,269 --> 00:41:30,769
Do you want something to drink?

213
00:41:34,019 --> 00:41:36,519
Whisky, martini?

214
00:41:36,769 --> 00:41:39,869
I'll drive! Only the bed and fast.

215
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:43,619
And music?

216
00:41:43,869 --> 00:41:48,379
No. Only the bed and be fast.

217
00:41:48,629 --> 00:41:55,139
- Ligia, undress!
- I have time to go

218
00:41:55,389 --> 00:41:58,889
i'm getting nervous.

219
00:42:04,139 --> 00:42:07,639
Delicious!

220
00:42:09,889 --> 00:42:14,000
I do anything you want

221
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:25,750
I do not like men, i like women
they smell good, soft skin.

222
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:32,100
Because of this i could not live in the
city, my family discovered everything

223
00:42:32,350 --> 00:42:34,251
I couldn't stand

224
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:40,750
I'm struggling with this now,
i'll like they could see me now.

225
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,501
They could understand my effort.

226
00:42:54,751 --> 00:42:56,251
Come.

227
00:42:56,501 --> 00:42:59,002
I'll get along.

228
00:43:44,252 --> 00:43:47,752
You're so cold, Ligia.

229
00:43:50,002 --> 00:43:52,002
Try.

230
00:43:53,252 --> 00:43:54,752
Try.

231
00:43:57,002 --> 00:43:58,502
Try.

232
00:43:58,752 --> 00:44:03,252
I need a body, Ligia.

233
00:44:03,502 --> 00:44:06,502
A man's body.

234
00:44:09,752 --> 00:44:11,252
Shit!

235
00:44:11,502 --> 00:44:13,002
Fuck!

236
00:44:16,252 --> 00:44:18,752
What's happening?

237
00:44:20,002 --> 00:44:22,502
Don't go, don't go.

238
00:44:22,752 --> 00:44:25,252
Shit! Let me go!

239
00:44:25,502 --> 00:44:27,002
I'm not a woman.

240
00:44:27,252 --> 00:44:29,752
I don't have pussy

241
00:44:30,002 --> 00:44:33,501
I know what you want. You
want to rub in a pussy!

242
00:44:33,751 --> 00:44:41,251
So go finger fucking. Nobody will
listen you. Go finger fucking. Shit.

243
00:44:41,501 --> 00:44:43,501
I do not know what this
fucking bitch is thinking.

244
00:44:43,751 --> 00:44:46,251
I could be in the city now.

245
00:44:46,501 --> 00:44:51,001
Shit! I'm belated again.

246
00:44:55,251 --> 00:44:58,751
This always happens
with me, fucking shit!

247
00:44:59,001 --> 00:45:00,511
Oh no.

248
00:45:08,761 --> 00:45:10,261
Fuck!

249
00:46:20,511 --> 00:46:21,211
Hello

250
00:46:21,461 --> 00:46:22,963
Ana Maria?

251
00:46:23,213 --> 00:46:24,715
Yes.

252
00:46:26,565 --> 00:46:28,466
Ligia?

253
00:46:29,016 --> 00:46:31,216
I want to see you.

254
00:46:31,466 --> 00:46:36,966
You ran away without tell where
you was going. You disappeared.

255
00:46:37,216 --> 00:46:39,716
Leaving us.

256
00:46:40,966 --> 00:46:44,466
Are you sure that you
really want to see me?

257
00:46:46,716 --> 00:46:50,216
I miss you!

258
00:46:50,466 --> 00:46:55,967
- I was with a man here.
-  A man? - Yes, a man.

259
00:46:56,217 --> 00:47:02,521
- You are so versatile, but do you liked?
- I don't know, we did not fuck.

260
00:47:02,771 --> 00:47:08,971
I was confused and the guy became
furious and said to me go finger fucking.

261
00:47:09,221 --> 00:47:11,721
He was a trucker.

262
00:47:11,971 --> 00:47:13,375
This is so ironic.

263
00:47:14,625 --> 00:47:16,125
Stupid.

264
00:47:17,675 --> 00:47:21,875
- Your isolation is dangerous.
- What do you mean?

265
00:47:22,125 --> 00:47:24,725
Is dangerous for me

266
00:47:24,975 --> 00:47:28,875
I want to take you back,
let's live together.

267
00:47:29,125 --> 00:47:31,625
I don't care about your family.

268
00:47:31,875 --> 00:47:35,375
I don't want to waste more time.

269
00:47:35,625 --> 00:47:37,525
We need more liberty.

270
00:47:40,775 --> 00:47:44,275
Let's live with who undertand us.

271
00:50:17,525 --> 00:50:20,125
This place is not bad.

272
00:50:20,375 --> 00:50:22,875
Yes i know.

273
00:50:23,125 --> 00:50:25,625
Is good to be in isolation.

274
00:50:25,875 --> 00:50:30,675
But what we did here could be
done in my place in the city.

275
00:50:30,925 --> 00:50:35,425
We have food delivery there.

276
00:50:35,675 --> 00:50:42,175
It would be great, but i think
i'm beginning to like this place.

277
00:50:42,425 --> 00:50:51,925
Ok, let's spend your parent's money on
this rent. I can come and go any time.

278
00:50:52,175 --> 00:51:04,675
I'll let you with good companion. So you'll
not wish to go around and find someone.

279
00:51:05,192 --> 00:51:07,192
I'm so curious to know what it is.

280
00:51:16,242 --> 00:51:22,753
Ta - da ....
- A vibrator.

281
00:51:23,004 --> 00:51:24,703
Yes.

282
00:51:26,953 --> 00:51:32,455
A guarantee of fidelity,
better than any male.

283
00:51:32,704 --> 00:51:39,204
No weight, no sweat, and no
hair to irritate your skin.

284
00:51:39,454 --> 00:51:42,254
Is just to introduce and turn on.

285
00:51:42,504 --> 00:51:47,184
You have an higienic and easy
orgasm because is just you that cum.

286
00:51:47,434 --> 00:51:48,935
Let's try it?

287
00:51:49,185 --> 00:51:51,885
I can do a free demonstration for you.

288
00:51:52,135 --> 00:51:54,935
No, let's do the opposite

289
00:51:55,185 --> 00:51:56,985
I'll stick on you.

290
00:51:57,235 --> 00:52:02,435
Like if we were man and woman.

291
00:52:05,685 --> 00:52:07,585
Suck this.

292
00:52:07,835 --> 00:52:11,355
Hold it tight, i want to try

293
00:52:11,605 --> 00:52:15,105
I want know how it would be

294
00:53:06,999 --> 00:53:08,855
Patricia

295
00:53:09,105 --> 00:53:12,705
do not allow this.

296
00:53:15,955 --> 00:53:18,455
Do not allow, Patricia.

297
00:53:18,705 --> 00:53:21,205
Do not allow.

298
00:53:29,455 --> 00:53:33,955
Terminate with this.

299
00:53:38,605 --> 00:53:42,705
Hold tight Patricia.

300
00:53:47,955 --> 00:53:49,455
Stronger.

301
00:53:52,705 --> 00:53:55,205
She's dying.

302
00:55:19,455 --> 00:55:21,955
Come in.

303
00:55:29,205 --> 00:55:32,705
Hi, are you lost?

304
00:55:32,955 --> 00:55:34,457
No, i live near here

305
00:55:34,707 --> 00:55:36,209
I'm home alone.

306
00:55:36,459 --> 00:55:37,959
Do you want a lift?

307
00:55:38,209 --> 00:55:41,709
Yes

308
00:55:45,959 --> 00:55:48,459
I like of you

309
00:55:48,709 --> 00:55:52,209
i never had someone like you.

310
00:56:01,459 --> 00:56:05,959
You turn me on.

311
00:56:06,209 --> 00:56:08,709
Wide open

312
00:56:10,969 --> 00:56:14,459
I'll get inside of you.

313
00:56:26,209 --> 00:56:29,229
Everything is inside, move now.

314
00:56:29,479 --> 00:56:33,979
Ligia, i need this body

315
00:56:34,529 --> 00:56:37,729
I need, Ligia.

316
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,579
Come on!

317
00:56:43,329 --> 00:56:46,100
Kill him.

318
00:56:46,350 --> 00:56:50,850
Give me the body.

319
00:56:51,100 --> 00:56:53,602
Kill him.

320
00:56:55,852 --> 00:56:58,351
It's my chance.

321
00:57:02,602 --> 00:57:05,302
Make me vibrate, make me cum.

322
00:57:05,552 --> 00:57:07,052
Cool.

323
00:57:07,302 --> 00:57:10,902
Kill him, give me.

324
00:57:11,802 --> 00:57:13,302
You'll not take him.

325
00:57:14,855 --> 00:57:17,852
Don't dare me, Ligia.

326
00:57:18,102 --> 00:57:20,602
Don't dare me.

327
00:57:20,852 --> 00:57:25,372
More, do not stop now.
Take me, take me away

328
00:57:25,622 --> 00:57:27,122
I warned you, Ligia.

329
00:57:28,372 --> 00:57:30,872
Feel your heart.

330
00:57:31,122 --> 00:57:34,622
It will explode.

331
00:57:34,872 --> 00:57:36,872
Takes me.

332
00:57:38,122 --> 00:57:40,622
What is that?

333
00:57:40,872 --> 00:57:43,672
Stop stop stop

334
00:57:44,722 --> 00:57:47,422
I want you.

335
00:57:47,672 --> 00:57:49,272
Fuck!

336
00:57:53,522 --> 00:57:55,022
Good grief!

337
00:57:58,272 --> 00:58:03,772
I warned you, Ligia, i warned.

338
00:58:07,022 --> 00:58:09,522
Good grief, this woman is crazy!

339
00:58:10,772 --> 00:58:12,273
Good grief!

340
00:58:38,523 --> 00:58:48,623
He witnessed everything, a judge determined an inquiry in the house.
The papers published what happened and we cannot rent the house.

341
00:58:48,873 --> 00:58:52,373
This scientist is
investigating the house.

342
00:58:52,623 --> 00:58:55,523
The police relatory do not satisfy him.

343
00:58:55,773 --> 00:58:59,213
He said wasn't the madness that
made Celia kill her husband.

344
00:58:59,463 --> 00:59:02,963
And Ligia did not have
heart related problems.

345
00:59:03,613 --> 00:59:05,713
He had access to the autopsy.

346
00:59:05,963 --> 00:59:08,863
Celia is my niece

347
00:59:10,113 --> 00:59:13,113
I want to know what made her insane.

348
00:59:13,506 --> 00:59:14,863
She's in an asylum now.

349
00:59:15,113 --> 00:59:17,613
Saying things about psychic influences

350
00:59:17,863 --> 00:59:24,363
about a head and a potted plant
that forced her to kill her husband.

351
00:59:24,613 --> 00:59:27,113
The potted plant.

352
00:59:27,363 --> 00:59:33,863
A girl named Tatiana said
more people was in the house

353
00:59:34,113 --> 00:59:39,613
Ana Maria, a Ligia's friend.

354
00:59:40,863 --> 00:59:47,100
A scientist can't do
nothing about what happened.

355
00:59:47,350 --> 00:59:50,050
What happened, Mr. Antonio?

356
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:54,000
It's not the house.

357
00:59:55,050 --> 01:00:02,750
We bought the house
ten, eleven years ago.

358
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:14,001
Myself, my wife Lia and my daughter
Patricia came from the country side

359
01:00:14,251 --> 01:00:18,751
and employed a person
from the neighborhood

360
01:00:19,001 --> 01:00:28,501
he helped me with the reconstruction
of the place. Arthur was poor

361
01:00:28,751 --> 01:00:34,251
one night when i waked up

362
01:00:34,501 --> 01:00:44,001
i discovered that him and
my daughter were having sex

363
01:00:47,251 --> 01:00:53,751
I couldn't stand that situation

364
01:00:54,001 --> 01:00:57,501
and i killed him on the road.

365
01:00:57,751 --> 01:01:05,251
You don't belive me, sir?

366
01:01:05,501 --> 01:01:15,001
It's why, Lia, my wife,
drunk until death too.

367
01:01:15,251 --> 01:01:20,251
Because of what i've done.

368
01:01:20,501 --> 01:01:24,001
My crimes...

369
01:01:24,251 --> 01:01:28,751
His severed head is over there.

370
01:01:29,001 --> 01:01:31,501
No decomposition.

371
01:01:31,751 --> 01:01:37,251
It emits vibrations
and forces the people.

372
01:01:37,501 --> 01:01:41,002
Come on, let's go!

373
01:01:43,252 --> 01:01:48,752
Shit! Fuck this rain!
Is an abandoned place.

374
01:03:12,002 --> 01:03:14,502
Enjoy

375
01:03:37,752 --> 01:03:38,252
Mario.

376
01:03:39,802 --> 01:03:41,302
Fuck.

377
01:03:43,552 --> 01:03:46,255
We have to keep this joint burning.

378
01:03:46,505 --> 01:03:51,005
You're burning me.

379
01:03:54,255 --> 01:03:56,755
Gimme this shit.

380
01:03:57,005 --> 01:03:59,505
What is this?

381
01:04:02,755 --> 01:04:05,255
Leave him.

382
01:04:06,005 --> 01:04:07,505
Son of a bitch.

383
01:04:07,755 --> 01:04:09,585
What's happening here,
fuck! You're burning me.

384
01:04:09,835 --> 01:04:11,335
Faggot.

385
01:04:11,585 --> 01:04:13,185
You bitch!

386
01:04:22,435 --> 01:04:26,935
Patricia, finish this.

387
01:04:29,985 --> 01:04:32,685
What's happening, who's knocking?

388
01:04:32,935 --> 01:04:34,437
Come here.

389
01:04:37,687 --> 01:04:43,587
Are you crazy? you're hurting
me. Leave me alone. Fuck!

390
01:05:25,837 --> 01:05:27,337
Leave me.

391
01:06:14,587 --> 01:06:16,087
Stop with this, stop!

392
01:06:16,337 --> 01:06:18,837
Fuck!

393
01:06:25,087 --> 01:06:27,587
Are you crazy?

394
01:06:32,837 --> 01:06:37,337
You're alright. What are we doing?

395
01:06:41,587 --> 01:06:44,087
Crazy, man.

396
01:06:44,337 --> 01:06:46,837
Step behind.

397
01:06:51,087 --> 01:06:53,587
Did you get a thrill?

398
01:06:53,837 --> 01:06:55,237
Let's get away from here

399
01:06:55,887 --> 01:06:58,987
I also hade to escape.

400
01:07:02,237 --> 01:07:06,737
Please go there Doctor, and prove.

401
01:07:10,987 --> 01:07:13,486
Do you belive in that old man?

402
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,237
I do not know.

403
01:07:15,487 --> 01:07:18,987
He doesn't know if it was 10, 11
or 12 years ago he bought the house.

404
01:07:19,237 --> 01:07:20,737
He's sclerotic

405
01:07:20,987 --> 01:07:24,000
i'm surprised, a
scientist with many doubts.

406
01:07:24,250 --> 01:07:25,750
But we have some evidence.

407
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:30,500
What evidence, the deaths?
Your friend's disappearance?

408
01:07:30,750 --> 01:07:33,250
There is much evidence of the
craziness of all these people.

409
01:07:33,500 --> 01:07:36,500
That old man is in the
right place, a hospice.

410
01:07:36,750 --> 01:07:40,250
But we need more, isolation he needs.

411
01:07:40,500 --> 01:07:47,000
And Ligia? Her family do
not want to see her anymore.

412
01:07:47,250 --> 01:07:53,750
They know she will
die, die of depression.

413
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:01,500
Doctor.

414
01:08:08,750 --> 01:08:10,250
Is Ana...?

415
01:08:10,500 --> 01:08:12,003
How do you know?

416
01:08:12,253 --> 01:08:15,759
Her hair clip.

417
01:08:21,009 --> 01:08:24,509
Call the police. I'll go to the house.

418
01:08:24,759 --> 01:08:27,259
This story....

419
01:08:27,509 --> 01:08:31,009
There is a dead woman's
body here, burned.

420
01:08:31,259 --> 01:08:39,759
Maybe we'll find more bodies, and
because of this you'll call the police.

421
01:08:40,009 --> 01:08:45,509
If i believe or not in what
that old man said is my problem.

422
01:08:45,759 --> 01:08:48,259
Here, give this to her.

423
01:08:48,509 --> 01:08:51,009
Come with us, you'll
prove nothing going there.

424
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,759
No.

425
01:08:55,809 --> 01:08:58,509
You can't manage that.

426
01:09:08,759 --> 01:09:10,259
Go faster.

427
01:09:10,509 --> 01:09:13,009
Is not necessary.

428
01:09:16,259 --> 01:09:18,000
He can be in danger.

429
01:09:18,250 --> 01:09:22,750
No, and i hope you not
believe in this bullshit

430
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:26,900
I shouldn't have let him go there.

431
01:09:27,150 --> 01:09:28,650
Is my house.

432
01:09:29,900 --> 01:09:31,400
What do you mean?

433
01:09:31,650 --> 01:09:39,651
I did an agreement with that old man, the
house is mine since i always rent it to someone.

434
01:09:42,901 --> 01:09:43,801
Stop the car.

435
01:09:44,051 --> 01:09:49,851
Let's have a break, Roberto will understand
how this is ridiculous and back out.

436
01:09:50,101 --> 01:09:53,101
He'll not arrive to the house.

437
01:09:53,351 --> 01:09:55,853
Stop! I want go out of the car!

438
01:09:56,103 --> 01:09:57,605
Are you crazy?

439
01:09:58,855 --> 01:09:59,955
Wait.

440
01:12:02,205 --> 01:12:14,706
Go there doctor, see the pot
and prove i'm saying the truth.

441
01:13:08,055 --> 01:13:10,455
My...

442
01:13:12,705 --> 01:13:14,205
...car...

443
01:13:47,455 --> 01:13:49,955
...is here.

444
01:13:52,205 --> 01:13:53,705
Police!

445
01:13:57,955 --> 01:13:58,955
It's him.

446
01:13:59,205 --> 01:14:01,705
Stop, if you move i'll shoot.

447
01:14:01,955 --> 01:14:05,455
He is in the trap, we caught him.

448
01:15:12,705 --> 01:15:16,205
Celia what are you doing
here? You should be in ...

449
01:15:16,455 --> 01:15:19,956
They are over there with Fabio.

450
01:15:20,206 --> 01:15:22,706
We got married just few years ago.

451
01:15:22,956 --> 01:15:25,456
He shouldn't have done this.

452
01:15:28,706 --> 01:15:32,206
You did not go to our wedding party

453
01:15:32,456 --> 01:15:36,956
I searched for you,
and i did not find you

454
01:15:37,206 --> 01:15:38,906
I was very sad.

455
01:15:39,956 --> 01:15:41,656
He is dead.

456
01:15:42,906 --> 01:15:44,406
Dead?

457
01:16:18,556 --> 01:16:20,156
Come here, come.

458
01:16:39,406 --> 01:16:41,906
We're waiting for you.

459
01:16:42,156 --> 01:16:50,796
We're in a new kind of therapy. The free
love in the marriage, or just the free love.

460
01:16:51,046 --> 01:16:54,549
She wants to fuck you.
And i want you to fuck her.

461
01:16:54,799 --> 01:17:00,299
Did you never imagine fucking my wife?
You will be the world's first stupid uncle.

462
01:17:00,549 --> 01:17:05,049
Because nieces are
always delicious, hot.

463
01:17:05,299 --> 01:17:07,799
Bring her here and let's make love.

464
01:17:08,049 --> 01:17:09,749
Yes, an orgy.

465
01:17:10,999 --> 01:17:18,499
Let's make an orgy, because the family
that fuck together will be always together.

466
01:17:42,749 --> 01:17:45,249
Ghost! Hahaha!

467
01:17:47,499 --> 01:17:49,999
I will kill you.

468
01:18:42,249 --> 01:18:44,749
You're trapped

469
01:18:44,999 --> 01:18:49,099
Patricia will finish everything.

470
01:18:49,349 --> 01:18:50,859
You can't.

471
01:18:51,109 --> 01:18:56,609
She just finished with
all the corrupted people

472
01:19:00,859 --> 01:19:02,359
Patricia.

473
01:19:02,609 --> 01:19:05,109
He'll not accept you after this.

474
01:19:08,359 --> 01:19:13,859
Everybody was without hope,
distorted and corrupted ones.

475
01:19:14,109 --> 01:19:17,609
She died to help me.

476
01:19:20,859 --> 01:19:22,379
She can't.

477
01:19:43,629 --> 01:19:45,129
Our dream.

478
01:19:45,379 --> 01:19:47,979
No, do not listen.

479
01:19:48,229 --> 01:19:50,729
Is the essence.

480
01:19:50,979 --> 01:19:52,779
Don't pay attention.

481
01:19:53,029 --> 01:19:54,528
Listen what i say.

482
01:19:54,778 --> 01:19:57,298
Listen what i say.

483
01:19:57,548 --> 01:19:59,048
Useless demagouge.

484
01:19:59,298 --> 01:20:00,798
Lies!

485
01:20:01,048 --> 01:20:05,548
Truth, you'll know.

486
01:20:07,098 --> 01:20:09,298
Listen.

487
01:20:09,548 --> 01:20:11,648
Listen.

488
01:20:12,198 --> 01:20:14,398
Listen.

489
01:20:14,648 --> 01:20:16,548
Listen.

490
01:20:21,798 --> 01:20:29,598
Your brain and your science will remain.
Your body and your nature will disappear.

491
01:20:29,848 --> 01:20:32,948
Will be mine!

492
01:20:34,198 --> 01:20:37,698
Son of a bitch!

493
01:21:24,948 --> 01:21:27,748
Now, Patricia.

494
01:21:58,398 --> 01:22:00,498
Protect the girl.

495
01:22:00,748 --> 01:22:02,248
Let's go there.

496
01:22:02,498 --> 01:22:03,998
Ok, boss.

497
01:22:04,248 --> 01:22:06,748
He's dead. His head was cut off.

498
01:22:06,998 --> 01:22:09,498
He is dead.

499
01:22:10,748 --> 01:22:12,548
His head.

500
01:22:12,798 --> 01:22:14,998
This girl is crazy,
there's nothing here.

501
01:22:15,248 --> 01:22:16,749
In the living room.

502
01:22:17,999 --> 01:22:20,499
Yeah, i think she is really crazy.

503
01:22:26,749 --> 01:22:34,349
The doctor succeeded.

504
01:22:34,599 --> 01:22:36,909
I tried to avoid the
police to go to the house.

505
01:22:37,159 --> 01:22:39,959
That girl, Tatiana, ruined everything.

506
01:22:40,209 --> 01:22:49,709
She told about her friend, told
about the recorder, told everything.

507
01:22:49,959 --> 01:22:52,459
This is the end of our agreement.

508
01:22:52,709 --> 01:22:58,609
I don't want to be the owner of the
house anymore. They are here outside.

509
01:23:01,759 --> 01:23:04,959
Doesn't matter.

510
01:23:16,209 --> 01:24:33,700
CINEMAGEDDOM
