1
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:07,006
So tell me about your day.
How's it going with the particle detector?

2
00:00:07,173 --> 00:00:08,674
Wow, you remember that?

3
00:00:08,883 --> 00:00:10,300
Yeah, I listen to what you say.

4
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:14,013
You're building a particle detector
using superfluid helium.

5
00:00:14,222 --> 00:00:17,891
You know, when you talk like that
I want to take you right here on this table.

6
00:00:18,893 --> 00:00:21,979
You know from experience
this table cannot support both our weight.

7
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:25,649
So how's the detector going?

8
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:27,776
It's tricky working with superfluids.

9
00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:32,072
Whatever container you put them in, they
creep up the sides and crawl out on their own.

10
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:34,575
Kind of like Sheldon's ant farm.

11
00:00:34,784 --> 00:00:37,703
Exactly. Except you don't have
a lunatic running around yelling:

12
00:00:37,912 --> 00:00:40,414
"I fed you sugar water.
Why are you biting me?"

13
00:00:40,665 --> 00:00:41,707
Ha.

14
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,209
You really want to talk about this?

15
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:48,213
I do. I didn't write "superfluid helium"
on this napkin for nothing.

16
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:54,011
Okay, well, this is cool. There's a thing
called superfluid vacuum theory...

17
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:57,848
...where empty space is imagined
as a superfluid with all of its qualities:

18
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:00,851
Viscosity, density, surface tension...

19
00:01:02,937 --> 00:01:06,815
If you're pausing for dramatic effect,
I'd keep it moving.

20
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:09,276
No, no.

21
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:12,863
People don't talk about surface tension.

22
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:16,408
If you imagine our three-space...

23
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:19,787
...as the surface of an N-dimensional
superfluid bubble...

24
00:01:19,996 --> 00:01:22,998
This is exciting.

25
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:26,085
This is really exciting.
I have to go find Sheldon.

26
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:29,338
Okay, well, if you find him,
use the kitchen island.

27
00:01:29,547 --> 00:01:32,174
That coffee table
will not support both of you.

28
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:37,471
Which means a spherical
multidimensional superfluid...

29
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,848
...shows the same
negative energy density as space-time.

30
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:42,392
What do you think? So, what do you think?

31
00:01:46,022 --> 00:01:47,481
Hmmm.

32
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:50,692
What? Is it wrong?
Have you seen it somewhere else?

33
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:55,239
Hmmm.

34
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:59,368
I know this isn't my area,
and I could never do math like you can...

35
00:01:59,577 --> 00:02:01,328
...but could this be something?

36
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:08,293
Well, you could've set
Newton's gravitational constant to one.

37
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:13,382
And the whole thing reeks of blueberry.
You know I can't stand these scented markers.

38
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:16,677
No one told you to taste them.

39
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:19,805
Come on, is this good or not?

40
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:23,767
- It's good.
- Really?

41
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:26,103
I like it. I think you're onto something.

42
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:28,480
- You do? Not messing with me?
- Not at all.

43
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:32,025
In fact, I have got something
for just such an occasion.

44
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:35,445
I was starting to think I might never
get a chance to give it to you.

45
00:02:36,197 --> 00:02:37,865
Good job.

46
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:44,371
You're giving me a sticker.

47
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:46,248
Not just a sticker.

48
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:50,586
It's a sticker of a kitty saying "mee-wow."

49
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:54,590
I'm not a preschooler.

50
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:58,260
- Fine, I'll take it back.
- I earned this. Back off.

51
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:27,039
You're still awake?

52
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:29,917
For a man whose last observation...

53
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:33,879
...was our universe may be the surface of
a multidimensional supercooled liquid...

54
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:37,007
..."you're still awake" seems
like quite the sophomore slump.

55
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:40,552
You worked out all the math.

56
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:43,263
Oh, I did more than work out all the math.

57
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:45,140
I wrote a paper.

58
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:48,644
You wrote a paper on my idea?

59
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:51,772
I wrote a paper on our idea.

60
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:54,233
When did my idea become our idea?

61
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:57,110
When I mixed it with Sheldony goodness...

62
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,072
...and cooked it
in the Easy-Bake Oven of my mind.

63
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:04,243
This is good.

64
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:05,911
Our idea's really good.

65
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:10,040
Well, the light bulb in this oven
is ridiculously bright.

66
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:14,878
You know, if no one's thought of this yet,
this could be a big deal.

67
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:18,674
Only way we'll know for sure
is if we post it online to the pre-print server.

68
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:22,094
I have it ready to go,
but I wasn't gonna do it without you.

69
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:26,306
It's all happening so fast.

70
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:29,059
Should we sleep on it?

71
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:33,522
We could, but we always run the risk
of someone else beating us to the punch.

72
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:36,149
You're sure it's good?

73
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:38,777
My name is right on there with yours.

74
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:42,155
That is a surefire mark of quality.

75
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:46,868
That might as well say,
"Directed by Joss Whedon."

76
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,498
Okay, partner, let's do it.

77
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,210
Come on.

78
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,296
Click the mouse with me.

79
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:05,429
One, two, three...

80
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:07,014
- ...click.
- Click.

81
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,727
Uh, we did it.

82
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:13,687
Yes, we did, my friend.

83
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:16,315
- Is your tongue blue?
- I don't want to talk about it.

84
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:22,696
- Movie night. What do you wanna watch?
- What happened to that movie you were in?

85
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:24,781
Oh, God, probably nothing.

86
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:28,994
I think I saw the director
twirling a sign outside the Verizon store.

87
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:32,122
- Search for it.
- What...? No, why?

88
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:35,250
- Because it would be fun to watch.
- It would be humiliating.

89
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,669
Well, now we have two reasons.

90
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:40,505
They have it.

91
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:42,758
- Please, can we watch it?
- Please.

92
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:45,177
Fine. But I'm telling you, it's terrible.

93
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:47,554
- Have you even seen it?
- No.

94
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:49,598
Maybe it turned out better than you think.

95
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:51,933
Bananas. Get your fresh bananas.

96
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:54,770
Ho, ho, it really didn't.

97
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:03,695
Sheldon, this is superfluid helium.

98
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:07,157
Put this in your mouth,
your tongue will freeze and break off.

99
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:10,702
Does it smell like blueberries?

100
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:14,247
- No.
- Then we're probably okay.

101
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:17,751
Hey, your paper got mentioned
on the Quantum Diaries physics blog.

102
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:22,089
- Really? What did they say?
- It's basically a summary of the theory...

103
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:25,717
- ...but there's a bunch of positive comments.
- Let me see. Let me see.

104
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:29,638
One calls it "Insightful and innovative."

105
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:31,473
We're insightful and innovative.

106
00:06:31,682 --> 00:06:35,977
- Ooh, nice to meet you, Mr. Insightful.
- Oh, the pleasure is mine, Mr. Innovative.

107
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:42,109
Another one says, "The concept shows
some real out-of-the-box thinking."

108
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:44,361
Do you hear that Mr. Out-Of-The?

109
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:47,197
I do indeed, Mr. Box-Thinking.

110
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:51,701
How are you today,
Mr. Can-You-Believe-These-Jackasses?

111
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:56,998
Just dandy,
Mr. I-Wish-I-Was-Better-At-Improv.

112
00:06:57,917 --> 00:06:59,918
- Read another one.
- Okay, okay. Um...

113
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:03,422
"The analogy between space-time
and a supercooled fluid...

114
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:05,757
...is either meaningless or false.

115
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:09,594
I wish this blog
would devote itself to real science...

116
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:14,850
...instead of wasting our time with crackpot,
wannabe theoreticians in a rush to publish."

117
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:17,352
- Who wrote that?
- It's anonymous.

118
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:20,147
Username, "General Relativity."

119
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:22,691
Well, I'm responding to it.

120
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,734
Uh, don't lower yourself to their level.

121
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:28,613
Look, I am simply going to defend our work,
scientist to scientist.

122
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:34,703
And failing that, suggest that his mother enjoys
a string of both human and non-human lovers.

123
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:37,581
Sheldon, my name's on that paper too.

124
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,416
There's no upside to doing this.

125
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:42,669
- He just left another comment.
- What does it say?

126
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:47,340
"Upon review, I've changed my mind
about the Cooper-Hofstadter hypothesis...

127
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:50,677
...that space-time is like a superfluid.
In fact, it's inspired me...

128
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:52,637
...to come up with my own theory:

129
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:56,016
Maybe space-time is like two clowns
with their heads in a bucket...

130
00:07:56,225 --> 00:07:59,019
...much like Cooper and Hofstadter."

131
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:01,855
Can I respond now?

132
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:03,523
Do it.

133
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:06,735
You mess with the bull, you get the horns.

134
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:11,406
I'm about to show this guy
just how horny I can be.

135
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:16,912
Somebody else do it.

136
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,082
Doctor, please help me.

137
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:24,127
I think I might be turning into a killer gorilla.

138
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:27,589
Why do you think
you're turning into a killer gorilla...

139
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:29,674
...and not just a regular gorilla?

140
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,386
Because regular gorillas are vegetarians...

141
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:36,848
...and I just bit the fingers off your receptionist.

142
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:39,309
Okay, we've seen plenty.

143
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,104
- No, give me the remote.
- Careful, she'll bite your fingers off.

144
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,815
I've been poking around the Internet...

145
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:48,818
...and I found something
we'll enjoy watching even more.

146
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:52,864
- What is it?
- Just a video of Bernadette in a beauty pageant.

147
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:55,283
- What?
- Okay, I learned my lesson.

148
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:57,702
Making fun of people is wrong.

149
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:02,123
I haven't learned my lesson. Play it. Play it.

150
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:11,174
Hi, I'm Bernadette Maryann Rostenkowski...

151
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:16,179
...from Yorba Linda, California.

152
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:19,474
Ha! You look like a talking cupcake.

153
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:24,396
And you should pick me for Miss California
Quiznos 1999, because I want to:

154
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:26,731
Tell you what I want
What I really, really want

155
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:28,066
I'll tell you what I want

156
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:31,027
What I really, really want
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna

157
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:36,366
Really, really, really be
Miss California Quiznos 1999

158
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:43,498
Play it again. Play it again.

159
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:50,463
Did he respond yet?

160
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:52,299
No, not yet.

161
00:09:52,466 --> 00:09:54,968
Hmm. Maybe we shouldn't
have sunk to his level.

162
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:56,595
It wasn't that bad.

163
00:09:56,804 --> 00:09:58,263
Read it back one more time.

164
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:03,351
"My good sir, we are neither
crackpots nor wannabes.

165
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:06,313
In fact, we are experts in our fields.

166
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:10,442
And while you hide behind your anonymity,
we stand behind our paper.

167
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:12,777
And later tonight, your mother."

168
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:21,286
- And you don't think that's too rough?
- We're just standing behind her.

169
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:24,873
It's not like we're gonna say
"boo" and scare her.

170
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,586
How could you not tell us
you were in beauty pageants?

171
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:31,338
Because it's embarrassing.

172
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:33,757
Ha! It is. It truly is.

173
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:39,679
Yeah, well, Amy writes
Little House on the Prairie fan fiction...

174
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:42,599
...about herself and posts it on the Internet.

175
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:46,353
No.

176
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:49,648
Why? What did I do?

177
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:51,775
Sorry. I had to get the spotlight off me.

178
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:54,611
And tearing down women
is part of my pageant training.

179
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:57,280
Okay, we are reading that right now.

180
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,533
- Please don't.
- We got embarrassed tonight, come on.

181
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:03,453
- But it's personal.
- Why? Is it about you and Sheldon?

182
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:05,455
No.

183
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:09,542
- Oh, my God, it's about her and Sheldon.
- It's not about me and Sheldon.

184
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:14,005
It's about a young woman
in the 1800s named Amelia...

185
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:18,134
...and the time-traveling physicist
named Cooper she falls in love with.

186
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:20,178
- Oh, please show us?
- Please.

187
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:22,806
- No.
- Uh! You know I'm gonna read it either way.

188
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:24,057
Good luck finding it.

189
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:30,563
"Amelia and the time-trav..." Found it. Ha, ha.

190
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:35,026
"It was just past dawn on the prairie
and like every morning...

191
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:37,153
...Amelia prepared to do her chores.

192
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:40,031
Except something about this morning
felt different."

193
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:41,741
Why?

194
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:46,204
Why did it feel different?

195
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:50,500
"Maybe it was the first whisper
of winter in the air.

196
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:53,962
Or maybe it was the unconscious
handsome man with porcelain skin...

197
00:11:54,171 --> 00:11:57,632
...and curious clothing
she was about to discover lying in the field.

198
00:11:57,842 --> 00:12:00,552
A man who would open
her mind to new possibilities...

199
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:03,680
...and her body to new feelings."

200
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:13,898
You know, there was a time
when I was alone and had no friends.

201
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:15,483
I'm starting to miss that.

202
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:21,698
He still hasn't responded.
What's taking him so long?

203
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:24,367
- Do you really want him to write back?
- Yeah, I do.

204
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:27,787
No matter how he responds,
I'm going to destroy him...

205
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:32,834
...with a picture of a bored cat,
saying "Oh, really?"

206
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:39,090
Mee-wow.

207
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:42,761
What are you doing?

208
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:48,016
I've created some other user accounts so I
can post positive comments about their paper.

209
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:52,937
"This wee little bairn of a theory
nearly blew my kilt off"?

210
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:56,149
No. You have to read it
how Dr. Angus McDoogal...

211
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:58,777
...of the University of Edinburgh would.

212
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:01,112
"This wee little bairn of a theory...

213
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,281
...nearly blew me kilt off."

214
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:07,327
Oh! He wrote back.

215
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:11,247
"Cooper and Hofstadter resorting
to juvenile attempts at humor...

216
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:14,542
...is proof they have nothing
to back up their ridiculous paper.

217
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:18,004
It should come as no surprise
given they work at Caltech...

218
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:23,802
...essentially a technical school where
even the physicists are basically engineers."

219
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:25,970
Engineers?

220
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:30,308
Do you know how insulting that is?

221
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:32,393
Yes.

222
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:36,815
Guys, this person's just going
out of their way to get a rise out of you.

223
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:38,983
Yeah, but it's still so aggravating.

224
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:41,736
All the other comments said nice things.
Focus on those.

225
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:47,575
Yeah. Dr. Dmitri Plancovik
of Moscow University said:

226
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:51,621
"This paper great. I love it more than vodka."

227
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:55,959
See? Better with the accent.

228
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:59,504
- And send.
- What did you write?

229
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:02,882
I'm done hiding from bullies.
I am taking this into the real world.

230
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:05,718
- What does that mean?
- I told him we'll meet face-to-face.

231
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:07,053
Anytime, anywhere.

232
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:10,014
You crazy?
You don't know who this person is. Delete that.

233
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:13,142
- Yeah, come on, Sheldon.
- Okay, okay, calm down.

234
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,188
It's him.

235
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:19,107
He's trying to video chat.

236
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:26,281
Perhaps I shouldn't have taken this
into the real world.

237
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:28,449
Oh, really?

238
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:34,163
"'Time travel, I don't understand,'
said Amelia.

239
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:36,958
Cooper stared at her,
'Which word don't you understand...

240
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:39,127
...time or travel?"'

241
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:43,673
Wow, even in your fantasies
Sheldon's kind of exhausting.

242
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,635
He's like that in the beginning
so she can change him.

243
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:49,178
It's called good writing.

244
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:52,348
And wishful thinking.

245
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:55,643
"It stung Amelia
when he spoke to her this way.

246
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:58,938
In her one-room schoolhouse
she was always the smartest student...

247
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:02,734
...regularly besting the boys in her class.
But this was no boy in front of her.

248
00:15:02,943 --> 00:15:03,985
This was a man."

249
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:05,904
Here we go.

250
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:09,657
"Cooper told Amelia about all the
incredible things the future would hold...

251
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:12,660
...like computers and living past 30.

252
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,662
He asked her if she had any questions.

253
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:18,166
All she longed to ask was if his heart
was beating as fast as hers...

254
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:20,710
...but she was too afraid
to hear the answer."

255
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,211
Oh, Amelia.

256
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:26,883
"So instead she asked if in the future
Montana ever became a state."

257
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:34,098
Hey, in the 1800s,
that was considered flirting.

258
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:39,228
I'm so sick of people
being mean on the Internet.

259
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:42,857
I think the anonymity makes everyone
feel like they can say things...

260
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:44,651
...they'd never say to your face.

261
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,111
Interesting.

262
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:51,240
I can't think of a single thing
I wouldn't say to someone's face.

263
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,535
I never noticed that about you.

264
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:59,457
You know what,
at least you guys did something.

265
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:04,587
You know, you had a theory, you wrote
a paper, you made an actual contribution.

266
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:08,091
All guys like this do is just tear down
other people's work.

267
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:10,969
He's right.

268
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:15,056
You know, I say we call this person back.

269
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:17,558
We've got no reason to hide.

270
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:21,104
All right, do it. Call him.

271
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:24,273
Let's find out what this loser's
ever accomplished.

272
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:29,112
Click it with me.

273
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:33,324
- One, two, three, click.
- Click.

274
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:38,121
Well, hello, there.

275
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:40,748
Professor Hawking?

276
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:44,419
Oh, brother, you should see
the look on your faces.

277
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:48,840
You really didn't like our paper?

278
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:51,426
I like your paper very much.

279
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:53,845
The premise is intriguing.

280
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,472
Then why are you attacking us?

281
00:16:56,682 --> 00:17:01,853
If you were sitting in a chair for 40 years,
you'd get bored too.

282
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:06,107
Anyway, gotta go.

283
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:10,361
I promised to help the neighbor kid
with his math homework.

284
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:13,114
Ciao.

285
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,995
Stephen Hawking liked our paper. Heh.

286
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:23,124
He said the premise is intriguing.

287
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:28,046
Good to see you again,
Mr. Stephen-Hawking-Liked-Our-Paper.

288
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:33,301
And you as well,
Mr. Our-Premise-Is-Intriguing.

289
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:37,889
How do you do,
Mr. I'll-Admit-That's-Pretty-Cool?

290
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:41,809
Yeah, you keep setting me up for failure.

291
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:48,149
"With a heavy heart, Amelia stood
before the newly-repaired time machine.

292
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:50,943
She regretted giving Cooper
the part he needed."

293
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:54,197
Because she wanted him
to give her the part she needed.

294
00:17:56,325 --> 00:18:00,036
- Okay, that's enough.
- No, I really wanna know what happens.

295
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:03,081
And Bernadette really, really,
wants to know what happens.

296
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:06,584
You're just making fun of me.

297
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:09,712
No, I was just kidding, I'm sorry.
And the story's really good.

298
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,714
No, it is. Does he stay?

299
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:15,510
Do they kiss?
Does she find out about Montana?

300
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:18,304
Please?

301
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,014
Fine.

302
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:26,771
"As Cooper prepared to depart,
tears filled Amelia's eyes.

303
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:32,068
He took her hand in his and said,
'I can't stay, but I will never forget you.'

304
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:37,865
He brushed his fingers against her cheek,
then quickly stepped into the machine.

305
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:41,911
'Please don't go,' she whispered,
but it was too late.

306
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,955
The engine hummed to life."

307
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:46,165
But they didn't even kiss.

308
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:50,962
"She turned away, wiping her eyes.
She couldn't bear to watch...

309
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:54,298
...her one chance at true love
disappear forever.

310
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:58,970
Then she felt a strong hand
on her shoulder spin her around.

311
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:00,263
It was Cooper."

312
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:02,765
Yes.

313
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:07,478
"'What about the future?' asked Amelia.

314
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:10,398
He looked deeply into her eyes
and whispered:

315
00:19:10,607 --> 00:19:12,817
'There is no future without you.'

316
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:15,194
He pulled her in close.

317
00:19:15,737 --> 00:19:17,947
She began to tremble all over.

318
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:20,283
She felt his warm breath..."

319
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:23,661
- You will not believe what Stephen Hawking...
- Get out!

320
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:37,258
Is the water warm enough?

321
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:41,262
Given the fact that you took the time
to build a wood fire...

322
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:45,349
...draw the water from the well and heat it,
it would be rude to complain.

323
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:50,313
But since you asked, it's a little nippy.

324
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:53,316
I can fix that.

325
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:02,992
I couldn't help but notice
your unusual undergarments.

326
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:06,621
They're not undergarments.
They're Underoos.

327
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:13,085
Where I come from, they're known
as "Underwear that's fun to wear."

328
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:17,882
And what's the significance of the spider?

329
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:20,801
Oh, that represents Spider-Man.

330
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:23,596
He does whatever a spider can.

331
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:28,893
There's a lot of rhyming in the future,
isn't there?

332
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:32,897
You're right.
This is even weirder than I thought.

333
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:36,484
- You want me to stop reading?
- Are you kidding? No, no.

334
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:41,530
"As he stood for Amelia to dry him..."
