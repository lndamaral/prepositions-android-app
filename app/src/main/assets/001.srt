3
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:42,942
Oh, Ross...

4
00:01:45,513 --> 00:01:47,601
I waited so 'much.

5
00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:55,247
I was dreaming about the first time you brought me here and I was afraid.

6
00:01:55,807 --> 00:01:56,951
Oh, Ross...

7
00:01:58,075 --> 00:01:59,941
I will not let Nampara.

8
00:02:00,921 --> 00:02:02,369
Is it OK for you...

9
00:02:02,471 --> 00:02:05,239
... You go away, you can return to your regiment.

00:02:05,614 --> 00:02:07,069
But me and Jeremy?

11
00:02:10,708 --> 00:02:11,872
What happened?

12
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:13,963
Ross?

13
00:02:14,995 --> 00:02:16,479
Ross, what 'happened?

14
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:18,584
Something 'success.

15
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:21,840
If you do not tell me, I do not ...

16
00:02:23,188 --> 00:02:24,536
Well, I will not '.

He could sleep under the groom. Mark the table.

00:02:50,923 --> 00:02:52,654
Map the wing of the fireplace.

25
00:02:53,852 --> 00:02:55,839
There 'a chair that you like, Hughie?

26
00:02:55,869 --> 00:02:56,583

31
00:03:10,743 --> 00:03:12,196
Are you thinking to castrated, right?

32
00:03:12,226 --> 00:03:13,820
No, the puledrina.

35
00:03:26,366 --> 00:03:28,552
Sir Hugh. Cosa ci fate qui?

36
00:03:28,582 --> 00:03:31,654
- I came to see what you have decided. - At this hour of the morning?

37
00:03:31,684 --> 00:03:34,697
I told Connie that vendevate everything and she did not want to wait. Me neither.

38
00:03:34,727 --> 00:03:37,371
- Oh, it does not do anything. - I have not even started.

39
00:03:37,401 --> 00:03:39,229
I mean, Ross is not 'more' in ruins.

40
00:03:39,259 --> 00:03:42,240
Damn, if a man and 'ruined, and' ruined ... and also a woman.

00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:43,659
Well, Ross is not '.

42

Oh, let me get down.

- Let me go up. - Not to sell the horses.

48
00:03:56,928 --> 00:04:00,415
- Let's talk about above. - The lounge and 'the place to talk.

49
00:04:00,714 --> 00:04:03,118
All right. First a kiss, then we talk.

50
00:04:03,568 --> 00:04:05,513
Oh ok. Close your eyes.

51
00:04:09,109 --> 00:04:11,018
Good morning Mrs. Poldark.

52
00:04:11,679 --> 00:04:15,557
Here lady ... I sold both horses and cows.

53
00:04:15,587 --> 00:04:19,109
Oh, stupid fool, 'cause you do not sell yourself?

54
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:20,896
Well, I tried.

I do not know what you said, but you and 'wrong. We do not sell anything.

56
00:04:25,528 --> 00:04:30,346
It 'the house, it' horses, nothing. Ross is not 'more' in ruins. He fixed everything.

57
00:04:30,376 --> 00:04:31,340
Hughie?

58
00:04:31,507 --> 00:04:34,017
Well, maybe not today are ruined, but yesterday they were.

59
00:04:34,047 --> 00:04:36,731
Some people do not know their place.

60
00:04:36,895 --> 00:04:39,090
In my day, when you were ruined ...

61
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,927
... It remained ruined.

62
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,706
Good day, madam.

63
00:04:44,998 --> 00:04:46,865
Pay no attention to her, my dear ...

64
00:04:46,895 --> 00:04:49,916
- ... Just remember that you are still in debt. - For what?

65
00:04:50,222 --> 00:04:52,214
You owe me a kiss ...

67
00:04:56,232 --> 00:04:58,763
Lady, what happens?

68
00:04:58,793 --> 00:05:02,774
None of your business, you go to replace everything.

69
00:05:03,018 --> 00:05:04,311
Sell ​​the horses!

70
00:05:04,341 --> 00:05:06,966
Before we go, then we must remain ...

71
00:05:06,996 --> 00:05:10,620
- What are these things? - They make you go crazy ...

72
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:11,575
Prudie.

73
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,454
Prudie, look.

74
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:17,363
- What is'? - I do not know.

75
00:05:18,118 --> 00:05:19,964
I do not understand what is.

76
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:23,884
- Take you. - It 's not my size. No ...

77
00:05:23,914 --> 00:05:25,777
- ... And 'men, I think. - Hmm.

78
00:05:26,598 --> 00:05:29,475
- Maybe the owner has bought for himself '. - Or for Jud.

79
00:05:30,006 --> 00:05:32,961
There you see him with this? It would seem a radish.

80
00:05:33,849 --> 00:05:37,117
- It was the Bodrugan? - They ', came to inspect.

81
00:05:38,901 --> 00:05:42,535
- Demelza, what are you doing with those? - I do not know. They are yours?

82
00:05:42,953 --> 00:05:46,270
Demelza, are for you. They are the latest fashion from France.

83
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:48,670
- Uh ... - they wear under clothes.

84
00:05:49,954 --> 00:05:54,310
- How, where nobody sees them? - Trencrom made me know that they found Mark Daniel.

85
00:05:54,340 --> 00:06:01,063
And 'in Ireland. But will 'to the Isles of Scilly to meet. The boat Trencrom part tonight. I've got to take it.

86
00:06:01,093 --> 00:06:03,330
- How much will you be gone? - A week.

87
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,527
Leave 'cargo bay and we will keep it here.

88
00:06:06,895 --> 00:06:08,480
It 's not safe, Ross.

89
00:06:09,075 --> 00:06:14,301
E 'perfectly safe. Charlie Kempthorne says there 'was an assessor for months.

90
00:06:14,331 --> 00:06:16,528
And 'true lady, and' pretty sure.

91
00:06:17,128 --> 00:06:18,821
You have to leave their own tonight?

92
00:06:18,851 --> 00:06:20,608
I have to see Mark Daniel.

93
00:06:20,861 --> 00:06:22,846
I do not see him with this.

94
00:06:34,689 --> 00:06:36,913
Bad weather bad times.

95
00:06:37,934 --> 00:06:39,770
You can not 'change the tempo.

96
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,510
For everything else up to us, do and decide.

97
00:06:42,767 --> 00:06:44,927
And 'what gives us' Providence.

98
00:06:45,532 --> 00:06:47,697
We are stupid enough to believe it.

99
00:06:49,107 --> 00:06:54,522
I guess it's Providence to make laws that put the poor in prison and leave free the rich.

100
00:06:54,933 --> 00:06:58,802
Providence has made my brother Mark Daniel a murderess, not Enys.

101
00:06:58,832 --> 00:07:01,934
- No, not him. - Do not you dare say a word against him. - Restrain your tongue, girl.

102
00:07:01,964 --> 00:07:06,729
They were good to me, him and the lady. She told me that I can go to his house.

103
00:07:06,872 --> 00:07:09,678
- You're going to marry Charlie Kempthorne. - I do not want.

104
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:12,650
You are my daughter and you do what I tell you!

105
00:07:16,699 --> 00:07:20,607
- Oh, not even the old Noe 'has never seen a shower so'. - What news?

106
00:07:25,484 --> 00:07:28,405
They will dock in the Bay of Nampara Saturday night.

107
00:07:28,435 --> 00:07:31,781
We carry goods and hide at home. Tell Zacky.

108
00:07:32,312 --> 00:07:35,465
And be careful. There are soldiers all Illogan.

109
00:07:35,587 --> 00:07:40,875
- Someone must have talked. - It 'was a mistake to bring Poldark. - Oh, and 'safe enough.

110
00:07:40,905 --> 00:07:43,055
Risks his skin as we do.

111
00:07:43,515 --> 00:07:47,845
- And 'He helped your brother escape. - I do not trust any of them.

112
00:07:49,124 --> 00:07:49,768
Phew!

113
00:07:50,393 --> 00:07:52,543
This cold entered into my bones.

114
00:07:52,921 --> 00:07:54,594
Should I go to the doctor.

115
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,847
What you need is a wife to keep you warm.

116
00:07:58,293 --> 00:08:00,407
You hear that, Rosina? Charlie cold.

117
00:08:00,437 --> 00:08:03,419
- Let him throw in the fire. - I'll show!

118
00:08:05,746 --> 00:08:08,544
- I'll see what ends up in the fire! - No!

119
00:08:09,067 --> 00:08:12,936
- No, she gave it to me! - It 'and I will burn it! - My doll!

120
00:08:13,966 --> 00:08:14,855
Burns.

121
00:08:16,112 --> 00:08:17,950
Bruciamoli all.

122
00:08:35,429 --> 00:08:37,158
Now you will have to marry me.

123
00:08:38,204 --> 00:08:41,092
I think I would have married 5 minutes after meeting you.

124
00:08:41,122 --> 00:08:45,693
Thing? You were so 'cocky just' cause I asked you to look at the poor little Horace.

125
00:08:45,723 --> 00:08:48,471
I never expected to marry the poor little Horace.

126
00:08:51,849 --> 00:08:52,939
Caroline...

127
00:08:53,174 --> 00:08:54,313
...are you sure?

128
00:08:54,775 --> 00:08:56,481
It will not be 'an easy life.

129
00:08:56,511 --> 00:08:58,806
But it will be 'a life with you, Dwight.

130
00:08:59,273 --> 00:09:02,121
I already 'had what you call an easy life ...

131
00:09:02,151 --> 00:09:04,415
... And I call an empty life.

132
00:09:04,926 --> 00:09:07,224
And there 'no one to satisfy but yourself.

133
00:09:07,561 --> 00:09:09,879
It becomes very difficult to meet.

134
00:09:12,113 --> 00:09:13,347
Are you sure?

135
00:09:13,878 --> 00:09:17,187
My love for you now and forever, and 'certain as death.

136
00:09:17,725 --> 00:09:21,399
And I accepted the fact that when we are married and we went away from here ...

137
00:09:21,429 --> 00:09:23,388
... I dipendero 'yourself.

138
00:09:23,664 --> 00:09:25,556
This we passed it.

139
00:09:25,586 --> 00:09:28,722
Caroline, I have to be honest, I will not run away like a thief.

140
00:09:28,752 --> 00:09:31,831
- A small subterfuge ... - I hate the subterfuge!

141
00:09:32,307 --> 00:09:34,796
If deceive others, deceive yourself.

142
00:09:34,826 --> 00:09:37,620
And what will they say? That I married you for your money.

143
00:09:38,388 --> 00:09:39,168
Thing?

144
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:43,533
When I give up to £ 40,000 marrying you?

145
00:09:44,337 --> 00:09:45,256
Dwight.

146
00:09:45,726 --> 00:09:47,248
It 's all set.

147
00:09:47,838 --> 00:09:50,774
Saturday night we leave together with my coach.

148
00:09:50,804 --> 00:09:54,775
- We go to London and we get married. I write to my uncle ... - Let me talk now.

149
00:09:54,805 --> 00:09:56,439
And he will say 'no.

150
00:09:56,687 --> 00:10:01,446
And then they will watch. And if he did not openly defy him must file 'more' word.

151
00:10:01,923 --> 00:10:07,943
- As if we ... - If we run, at the time, the old gentleman is going to change 'idea and you will leave' all his money.

152
00:10:13,249 --> 00:10:15,286
Potra 'seem strange ...

153
00:10:16,178 --> 00:10:18,271
But I care about the old gentleman.

154
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:20,324
I do not want to hurt him.

155
00:10:20,682 --> 00:10:22,091
The lighthouse 'for you ...

156
00:10:22,905 --> 00:10:25,096
... But I want to do as little as possible.

157
00:10:32,099 --> 00:10:33,353
Poor Dwight.

158
00:10:34,824 --> 00:10:37,160
Do you want people to think well of you ...

159
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:38,543
... And not be 'so'.

160
00:10:39,218 --> 00:10:42,231
Do you want everyone to be happy and they are not.

161
00:10:43,505 --> 00:10:45,057
Do you want to be good ...

162
00:10:46,007 --> 00:10:47,345
... But you can not.

163
00:10:49,878 --> 00:10:51,827
I do not want to be good, now.

164
00:10:52,622 --> 00:10:54,757
And then 'my time to go on.

165
00:10:55,724 --> 00:10:58,867
You can kiss me once ... with a lot of passion.

166
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:02,225
Then you must be patient, doctor.

167
00:12:19,183 --> 00:12:20,215
Mark Daniel.

168
00:12:24,075 --> 00:12:26,165
I never thought you would see.

169
00:12:26,195 --> 00:12:29,144
I should be dead by now. May God have mercy 'me.

170
00:12:29,174 --> 00:12:31,021
You paid for this' you did.

171
00:12:31,051 --> 00:12:33,022
Not in 1,000 years.

172
00:12:34,613 --> 00:12:37,184
Your brother sends you his greetings. Paynter also ...

173
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:38,527
... Zacky Martin ...

174
00:12:38,736 --> 00:12:39,941
...my wife.

175
00:12:40,194 --> 00:12:41,908
I have a son now, Mark.

176
00:12:43,766 --> 00:12:45,941
Come on, you want to drink?

177
00:12:48,247 --> 00:12:50,351
Tell me what you have done in recent years.

178
00:12:53,706 --> 00:12:57,318
I killed her every day since that day.

179
00:12:58,544 --> 00:13:00,104
Every hour by hour.

180
00:13:00,972 --> 00:13:03,556
I continued to kill millions of times.

181
00:13:04,115 --> 00:13:06,723
In one country or another and 'always the same.

182
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:11,140
Do not talk to you or others, tell me about her.

183
00:13:12,584 --> 00:13:16,534
- You put a tombstone? - It '... with his name, nothing else.

184
00:13:16,564 --> 00:13:19,756
You should write "Killed by Mark Daniel."

185
00:13:20,764 --> 00:13:23,149
- For the love of God. - For the love of God?

186
00:13:27,614 --> 00:13:28,980
What do you want from me?

187
00:13:29,573 --> 00:13:32,713
Whatever a dead man can do, the lighthouse 'for you.

188
00:13:35,289 --> 00:13:38,492
I have to bring you back to that day when you hidden in June 'to Wheal Grace.

189
00:13:38,522 --> 00:13:40,860
He said that he saw the copper. Remember?

190
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,171
Mark, I reopened the mine.

191
00:13:46,319 --> 00:13:50,832
Henshawe and I, Zacky and others, we have explored all and nothing found.

192
00:13:51,349 --> 00:13:52,956
Now, I have a bit 'of money ...

193
00:13:54,063 --> 00:13:55,605
... But it will soon end.

194
00:13:55,635 --> 00:13:58,697
... I have to find the copper, or there will be 'more' mine ...

195
00:13:58,942 --> 00:14:01,393
... It 'work. You know what that means.

196
00:14:02,197 --> 00:14:07,299
I rely on you 'cause you tell me what you saw that day, and where you saw it. Do you understand?

197
00:14:07,329 --> 00:14:09,969
E 'was more' than four years ago.

198
00:14:09,999 --> 00:14:12,640
- I was a little 'upset. - Well, think again.

199
00:14:13,924 --> 00:14:16,069
You come down in the main shaft.

200
00:14:17,966 --> 00:14:20,027
They went down into the main shaft.

201
00:14:21,926 --> 00:14:26,212
There was a tunnel that led to the east. The land looked good.

202
00:14:26,242 --> 00:14:28,373
And 'where we dug a new well.

203
00:14:28,403 --> 00:14:33,058
There was a line of copper, but low quality ', and hardly worth the effort to extract it. It was all there '.

204
00:14:33,088 --> 00:14:35,414
No, ce n'era uno grosso.

205
00:14:35,557 --> 00:14:36,354
Where?

206
00:14:36,504 --> 00:14:39,160
I had other things to think about. I just ...

207
00:14:45,272 --> 00:14:47,498
I returned to the main shaft ...

208
00:14:47,935 --> 00:14:50,493
... And I have traveled throughout its length.

209
00:14:51,895 --> 00:14:54,426
I had nothing to do but wait.

210
00:15:01,551 --> 00:15:03,354
Then I heard the soldiers.

211
00:15:07,352 --> 00:15:10,222
Cosi 'I ... I opened the entrance of a tunnel.

212
00:15:24,984 --> 00:15:27,164
I had with me a piece of candle.

213
00:15:29,518 --> 00:15:34,547
I climbed up and found myself in a tunnel wide enough for the passage of a man, and deep.

214
00:15:35,899 --> 00:15:41,205
I think it was just under the old strand. He dripped everywhere and rock steps were full of water.

215
00:15:41,235 --> 00:15:43,612
It was dangerous ground and at the end ...

216
00:15:47,235 --> 00:15:48,531
... You were there?

217
00:15:49,142 --> 00:15:53,408
Mr. Francis has found the same place. And 'them dead'. He drowned.

218
00:15:55,224 --> 00:15:56,664
Rest in peace.

219
00:15:57,509 --> 00:15:58,867
He found the copper?

220
00:16:00,185 --> 00:16:01,700
There are some clues ...

221
00:16:01,949 --> 00:16:03,275
... Good clues.

222
00:16:06,084 --> 00:16:08,734
You have reopened the mine because of me ...

223
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:11,143
... And this has killed your cousin.

224
00:16:11,356 --> 00:16:13,978
They are a curse to all those who know me.

225
00:16:14,008 --> 00:16:19,298
Guilt and 'what my anyone else. If we could predict the consequences of our actions ...

226
00:16:20,234 --> 00:16:23,558
Mark, you can not continue to live under the weight of this guilt.

227
00:16:23,588 --> 00:16:24,947
I pray to God ...

228
00:16:25,478 --> 00:16:26,754
... Not to.

229
00:16:28,838 --> 00:16:32,130
Now leave me alone. I'm not a good company for you.

230
00:16:34,205 --> 00:16:36,263
Do you need something? Money?

231
00:16:36,755 --> 00:16:38,424
I embark 'on Saturdays.

232
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:40,883
Do you have a message for someone?

233
00:16:41,264 --> 00:16:44,277
Go to her, that I killed her, and tell her ...

234
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:46,286
"Soon".

235
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:55,427
Dwight.

236
00:16:56,989 --> 00:16:58,166
Thanks, Prudie.

237
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:05,550
- I came to see Ross. - Oh, not 'here. However he will be back 'tomorrow.

238
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:07,245
It was something important?

239
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:09,394
Demelza ...

240
00:17:09,424 --> 00:17:12,233
... We've known for a long time, I know I can trust you.

241
00:17:12,263 --> 00:17:14,500
Dwight, there are no secrets between us.

242
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:18,634
Ross and 'went to St. Mary's, Isles of Scilly. E 'went to see Mark Daniel.

243
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:21,745
E 'for Wheal Grace. Sorry, Dwight.

244
00:17:22,438 --> 00:17:25,090
But he will be back 'with the boat Trencrom tomorrow night.

245
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,683
They will land in the bay at midnight.

246
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:32,186
- But it 's dangerous. I saw that officer, the Scottish wandering over there days ago. - Oh, he 's pretty harmless.

247
00:17:32,216 --> 00:17:34,062
Ross will 'return Sunday.

248
00:17:34,389 --> 00:17:36,033
By then it will be 'party.

249
00:17:36,398 --> 00:17:38,129
See, I have a secret.

250
00:17:38,844 --> 00:17:39,783
Demelza ...

251
00:17:40,254 --> 00:17:42,031
... I came to say goodbye.

252
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:44,837
- Tomorrow ... - going to marry Caroline Penvenen.

253
00:17:45,672 --> 00:17:46,550
The sai?

254
00:17:47,408 --> 00:17:50,512
Just a rabbit face peeking out of the den and everyone knows it.

255
00:17:50,542 --> 00:17:52,583
Two people on horseback, well ...

256
00:17:53,132 --> 00:17:56,533
Oh, Dwight, are so 'happy for you. For both.

257
00:17:57,133 --> 00:18:00,467
Well, I just hope that your secret is more 'safe mine.

258
00:18:00,674 --> 00:18:03,195
We will meet at midnight at the gates of Kilwarren.

259
00:18:03,225 --> 00:18:05,170
We go to London and we get married.

260
00:18:05,346 --> 00:18:07,665
- I will write to you'. - You'll be back, though.

261
00:18:09,038 --> 00:18:10,673
I'd like to, Demelza ...

262
00:18:10,703 --> 00:18:12,205
... But how can I do?

263
00:18:12,235 --> 00:18:17,871
How can I ask you to live here, in a house that is' on the border of the estate of his uncle, the man we are going to betray?

264
00:18:17,901 --> 00:18:18,633
No...

265
00:18:18,922 --> 00:18:20,372
... And 'unthinkable.

266
00:18:20,402 --> 00:18:21,684
Where will you go?

267
00:18:21,822 --> 00:18:24,803
Apriro' uno studio a Londra o a Bath.

268
00:18:25,046 --> 00:18:27,884
I think they 'have diseases other than here.

269
00:18:28,027 --> 00:18:32,840
They suffer from the abundance, instead of lack. But I lighthouse 'my best to treat them.

270
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:36,435
Will you tell Ross and all who are here have believed me?

But you know I do not ritornero '.

275
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:50,852
Tomorrow my life will change '.

276
00:18:50,882 --> 00:18:53,170
Nothing will be 'more' the same after tomorrow.

277
00:18:55,884 --> 00:19:01,865
- You stop very, captain? - No, not really. - Soon the tide changes. - Bring my bag to the ship. - Yes, sir.

278
00:19:01,895 --> 00:19:03,460

Thanks, Charlie.

282
00:19:46,886 --> 00:19:48,841
Have you been here quite a while ', eh?

283
00:19:49,082 --> 00:19:51,374
I came to find Rosina, right?

You were nice to him, huh, girl?

Cold, dark, eh, Charlie?

289
00:20:02,797 --> 00:20:04,296
Too cold for me.

290
00:20:04,643 --> 00:20:06,878
Too cold for guard, and this' sure.

291
00:20:06,908 --> 00:20:09,451
- I think the trip will go 'smooth. - Yes'.

292
00:20:11,033 --> 00:20:12,064
Are you OK?

293
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:15,154
- Did you see the doctor, right? - I saw it.

00:20:15,184 --> 00:20:18,042
- What did he say? - She said I should stay in bed.

He said he will 'fever.

296
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:22,139
The fever?

297
00:20:22,482 --> 00:20:23,062
And '.

298
00:20:24,103 --> 00:20:28,786
You should not come out with us. You should be at home, in bed, like she told him.

299
00:20:28,816 --> 00:20:31,584
But Jacka, I will lose 'my part if I'm not coming.

300
00:20:32,085 --> 00:20:34,829
You do not worry for that.

301

We care for you, Charlie, you know.

00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:40,084

Take care.

310
00:20:57,491 --> 00:20:59,006
Poor old Charlie.

311
00:21:00,897 --> 00:21:03,169
Should be held to if 'his fever.

312
00:21:03,593 --> 00:21:05,895
And yet 'a kind man, and' came to see you.

313

- You shall love those who will tell you 'I love! - I will not do that'! - You will do it!

317
00:21:17,398 --> 00:21:21,961
War, war, nothing but war, and yet we will not be ready when it comes.

318
00:21:21,991 --> 00:21:27,399
The French are gathering their army to invade, and what do we do? We gather the Parliament.

319
00:21:27,429 --> 00:21:28,798
Look here.

320
00:21:28,828 --> 00:21:32,449
A group of ladies parading patriotic riding in the park ...

321
00:21:32,479 --> 00:21:36,501
... With red lips, white faces and noses blue.

322
00:21:37,142 --> 00:21:42,614
Mr. Pitt, the well-known bachelor, say sleep with a map of Europe next to his bed.

323
00:21:43,101 --> 00:21:46,354
We might expect happy events in France for the summer.

324
00:21:46,384 --> 00:21:47,937
Oh, nonsense.

325
00:21:48,519 --> 00:21:49,356
Uncle ...

326
00:21:49,979 --> 00:21:51,685
... 'Cause you never married?

327
00:21:51,715 --> 00:21:55,101
Well, my dear, not all women have pretty good assets.

328
00:21:55,131 --> 00:21:58,816
Besides this', I took care of you in the last 20 years.

329
00:21:59,031 --> 00:22:03,144
- If I had accepted Mr. Trevaunance ... - No, no, you were right to leave him.

330
00:22:03,174 --> 00:22:05,276
You deserve a better man.

331
00:22:06,353 --> 00:22:08,661
If you know a better man ...

332
00:22:09,008 --> 00:22:10,469
... And so sposassi ...

333
00:22:10,967 --> 00:22:13,987
... We would always come to see you, to be with you ...

334
00:22:15,282 --> 00:22:16,221
...if you want it.

335
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:20,214
Of course it will be 'so', my dear. Nothing would give me more 'happy to have you here.

336
00:22:20,947 --> 00:22:24,134
And I want you to bring all my pronipotini with you.

337
00:22:28,469 --> 00:22:29,786
Dear Uncle Pen.

338
00:22:32,263 --> 00:22:35,924
You do not call me more 'so' since you were little, Caroline.

339
00:22:36,374 --> 00:22:41,980
I'm an old selfish to keep you here, away from all the entertainment you you young.

340
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:45,519
Theater, dancing, horseback riding in the park.

341
00:22:45,549 --> 00:22:47,927
Oh, I do not want those things.

342
00:22:47,957 --> 00:22:51,856
At the end of the month we will go on to London and we will be a bit 'uncle William and his family.

343
00:22:51,886 --> 00:22:53,406
I owe him a visit ...

344
00:22:53,436 --> 00:22:55,642
... And you'll have the city 'at your feet.

345
00:22:55,672 --> 00:23:01,111
I have several old friends who would be more 'than happy to receive Miss Caroline Penvenen.

346
00:23:01,141 --> 00:23:03,767
Please, Uncle, do not make plans for me.

347
00:23:03,797 --> 00:23:06,221
- Why 'no, my dear? - Please, uncle.

348
00:23:08,204 --> 00:23:10,082
I know how you hate London.

349
00:23:10,366 --> 00:23:14,541
You stay here, happy and healthy, close to your fireplace.

350
00:23:14,571 --> 00:23:16,036
E tu, Caroline?

351
00:23:17,501 --> 00:23:19,462
I'll stay 'with you until' I can.

352
00:23:20,907 --> 00:23:23,958
And then forget all the promises I made ...

353
00:23:24,233 --> 00:23:26,592
... And all the hopes he had for me ...

354
00:23:27,233 --> 00:23:29,806
... And what comfort I could be for you.

355
00:23:30,979 --> 00:23:34,532
Remember Caroline ... who loves his Uncle Pen.

356
00:23:35,212 --> 00:23:36,457
What do you say?

357
00:23:36,927 --> 00:23:39,103
I made my will, my dear.

358
00:23:39,133 --> 00:23:40,966
Not gonna change 'now.

359
00:23:41,776 --> 00:23:43,227
Sara 'all yours.

360
00:23:44,766 --> 00:23:46,707
I did not think to your will.

361
00:23:47,797 --> 00:23:49,533
I was doing my.

362
00:24:16,984 --> 00:24:18,220
Rosina.

363
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:21,079
Rosina, what 'happened?

364
00:24:22,162 --> 00:24:23,088
Come ...

365
00:24:25,335 --> 00:24:26,534
...sit here.

366
00:24:26,885 --> 00:24:28,555
He bows his head forward.

367
00:24:33,235 --> 00:24:35,088
... Force pulled up.

368
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:39,070
Who did so '?

369
00:24:39,671 --> 00:24:40,365
Mhm?

370
00:24:40,886 --> 00:24:42,541
Rosina, you must tell me.

371
00:24:43,245 --> 00:24:44,316
My father.

372
00:24:44,785 --> 00:24:45,622
Why'?

373
00:24:46,112 --> 00:24:48,972
'Cause I said I did not want to marry Charlie Kempthorne.

374
00:24:49,002 --> 00:24:51,081
He hits you like that?

375
00:24:51,398 --> 00:24:52,535
Where is he now?

376
00:24:52,834 --> 00:24:56,261
E 'went down' to the beach with the other. Tonight comes the boat.

377
00:24:56,291 --> 00:24:57,338
Sure.

378
00:24:58,273 --> 00:25:02,001
And just 'I came out, I ran away. I went all the way to race.

379
00:25:02,519 --> 00:25:05,481
I was going to Kilwarren, but it 's too far.

380
00:25:05,511 --> 00:25:06,987
'Cause just the'?

381
00:25:07,017 --> 00:25:09,244
'Cause the lady said I could.

382
00:25:09,704 --> 00:25:13,263
There 'some other place you can go? From someone Sawle?

383
00:25:13,756 --> 00:25:17,438
Rosina, Miss Penvenen and I leave tonight.

384
00:25:17,468 --> 00:25:21,819
I have to leave soon. How about Zacky Martin? It 'a good man.

385
00:25:23,001 --> 00:25:24,252
E 'with others.

386
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:27,224
So who 'remained in Sawle tonight?

387
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:32,256
The women. But they will not enter for fear of their male relatives.

388
00:25:32,286 --> 00:25:35,483
There is nobody. No one but Kempthorne.

389
00:25:35,513 --> 00:25:37,605
'Cause he's not' the beach?

390
00:25:37,817 --> 00:25:40,483
And 'sick, has a fever, you know.

391
00:25:40,735 --> 00:25:42,210
No, I did not.

392
00:25:44,024 --> 00:25:46,615
He says you told to stay at home ...

393
00:25:46,645 --> 00:25:51,046
- ... Otherwise it would go down 'to meet the captain. - Captain Poldark?

394
00:25:51,249 --> 00:25:52,758
Rosina, are you sure?

395
00:25:52,788 --> 00:25:55,026
Who said so '? He had seen?

396
00:25:55,056 --> 00:25:57,525
- I heard him say so '. - Why'?

397
00:25:58,697 --> 00:26:01,322
'Cause he lied to not participate tonight?

398
00:26:01,942 --> 00:26:03,829
Rosina, what will they do?

399
00:26:03,859 --> 00:26:08,759
- They will carry the goods to Nampara. Let me come with you. - They talked about the soldiers?

400
00:26:08,789 --> 00:26:12,962
Charlie said that he has seen, for Illogan. Oh, let me come with you.

401
00:26:12,992 --> 00:26:15,788
You will be with me until Sawle. There 's hardly the time.

402
00:26:17,672 --> 00:26:23,344
- You have to go home to your father. - Oh, no, I do not want ... - Hurry up. Rosina, you have to go there. Come with me, come on.

403
00:27:03,488 --> 00:27:04,560
Kempthorne!

404
00:27:08,275 --> 00:27:10,356
Kempthorne, open the door!

405
00:27:13,775 --> 00:27:15,463
Let me in, Kempthorne!

406
00:27:16,458 --> 00:27:18,825
You can not enter. I have a fever.

407
00:27:18,855 --> 00:27:21,807
I'm Dr. Enys, Kempthorne. Open the door.

408
00:27:22,287 --> 00:27:26,071
Otherwise it will wake up 'around the village, so' will hear what I have to say.

409
00:27:26,101 --> 00:27:27,044
Check.

410
00:27:44,755 --> 00:27:47,073
He sent someone 'cause I'm sick?

411
00:27:47,103 --> 00:27:48,920
You are not ill, Kempthorne.

412
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:50,694
Still you do not have a fever.

413
00:27:50,957 --> 00:27:54,379
You lied to find an excuse not to go with the others. Why'?

414
00:27:54,409 --> 00:27:55,786
What will happen'?

415
00:27:56,285 --> 00:27:58,192
I sweated with fever.

416
00:27:58,222 --> 00:27:59,673
Sweat with fear.

417
00:28:00,449 --> 00:28:01,971
You have been discovered.

418
00:28:02,001 --> 00:28:04,376
You know what's gonna happen 'tonight. What '?!

419
00:28:04,406 --> 00:28:06,654
Next, I have no time to waste on you.

420
00:28:08,497 --> 00:28:10,101
They are the soldiers, right?

421
00:28:10,693 --> 00:28:12,153
Not to Illogan ...

422
00:28:12,183 --> 00:28:13,491
... Are Nampara!

423
00:28:14,255 --> 00:28:17,737
- How should I know? - 'Cause you told them to go'.

424
00:28:19,161 --> 00:28:21,115
I am a man of Trencrom.

425
00:28:21,622 --> 00:28:24,134
I never laid a trap for him.

426
00:28:24,479 --> 00:28:26,348
This you would, if well paid.

427
00:28:26,522 --> 00:28:27,507
Reply !!

428
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:29,238
You are crazy.

429
00:28:32,491 --> 00:28:35,452
Crazy, 'cause you like Rosina Hoblyn.

430
00:28:35,636 --> 00:28:38,004
As the other girl, Daniel Keren.

431
00:28:38,034 --> 00:28:40,023
And I'd get Rosina.

432
00:28:43,452 --> 00:28:45,829
If you gain a little 'extra money ...

433
00:28:46,329 --> 00:28:47,646
... Who know '?

434
00:28:48,911 --> 00:28:50,514
I do not tell.

435
00:28:51,809 --> 00:28:54,907
And you'll have trouble speaking with his throat cut.

436
00:29:00,816 --> 00:29:02,790
There are soldiers in Nampara.

437
00:29:03,131 --> 00:29:04,450
It will take many.

438
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,933
- Even your friends. - There will be 'more' for those who remain.

439
00:29:09,431 --> 00:29:11,185
You do not have a chance, Doctor.

440
00:29:11,215 --> 00:29:14,300
I already 'killed a man and not' a terrible thing.

441
00:29:16,697 --> 00:29:18,565
When they find the body ...

442
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,995
... I'll tell him 'it was you to say to the soldiers.

443
00:29:22,025 --> 00:29:24,821
All in all, and 'fortunate that you came here.

444
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:04,973
Oh ... oh, my leg!

445
00:30:05,736 --> 00:30:08,164
I broke my leg, doctor.

446
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:09,411
Doctor!

447
00:30:39,165 --> 00:30:42,739
- The boat and 'late. - E 'anchored behind the cape, I think.

448
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:48,246
- I can not see anything. - There should be a man on top of the cliff.

449
00:30:48,276 --> 00:30:51,175
And that 'the location of Charlie. Is sick.

450
00:30:51,471 --> 00:30:53,971
It 's not the only one who is sick tonight.

451
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:55,708
Here comes the boat.

452
00:31:39,229 --> 00:31:40,506
Soldiers !!!

453
00:31:42,028 --> 00:31:43,917
Soldiers !!!

454
00:31:46,322 --> 00:31:48,048
Soldiers !!!!

455
00:31:48,793 --> 00:31:50,844
Soldiers !!!!

456
00:31:54,303 --> 00:31:56,379
Remate, dammit, paddle!

457
00:31:57,505 --> 00:31:58,973
Get off, you.

458
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:01,792
Raised the anchor, set sail.

459
00:32:01,822 --> 00:32:03,528
Let's go away!

460
00:32:03,885 --> 00:32:04,925
Via!

461
00:32:11,943 --> 00:32:16,005
- Betrayed. - They ruined. - Until 'and' still dark we must try to reach safety.

462
00:32:16,035 --> 00:32:17,588
Do you feel the force, Captain?

463
00:32:17,618 --> 00:32:22,254
Let's go to the other side of the headland to lose them. We part so 'can not take everyone.

464
00:32:22,284 --> 00:32:25,233
Come on, we know what to do. Come on, Captain.

465
00:32:25,263 --> 00:32:26,660
May God be with you!

466
00:32:26,997 --> 00:32:31,526
- Ah, damn the man who lit the fire. - Do not worry, sir, we'll get him.

467
00:32:31,556 --> 00:32:35,264
I wanted the smugglers, not a handful of poor people.

468
00:32:35,294 --> 00:32:39,474
- A man reached the beach, sir. - Oh, I think it's the last man I want to see behind bars.

469
00:32:39,504 --> 00:32:43,741
They are all strangers, sir. These Cornish are all strangers.

470
00:32:43,771 --> 00:32:47,950
There and 'came to mind, Sergeant, that here you are the foreigner?

471
00:33:15,556 --> 00:33:16,598
Next ...

472
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:51,282
You'll get what you deserve!

473
00:33:56,706 --> 00:33:57,758
Arrenditi!

474
00:34:21,425 --> 00:34:23,802
Damn, let me!

475
00:34:24,585 --> 00:34:28,091
- Do not you understand? What time is it? - Time? - Yes'!

476
00:34:29,455 --> 00:34:31,863
It's almost six.

477
00:34:31,893 --> 00:34:37,181
- And I do not think you'll need to know the time for the next two years. - We have to take away the prisoners, sir? - Not yet.

478
00:34:37,211 --> 00:34:41,745
- Have you got ...? - Not your Captain Poldark, if and 'him think that, but we will.

479
00:34:41,775 --> 00:34:43,914
I know where he intends to go into hiding.

480
00:34:43,944 --> 00:34:46,344
Well, Sergeant, gather your men.

481
00:34:49,722 --> 00:34:53,876
The boat and 'left off. I think the captain is still on board.

482
00:34:53,906 --> 00:34:55,620
- Who else did you see? - Soldiers.

483
00:34:55,650 --> 00:34:59,161
- Where? - Everywhere. And the majority were on this side.

484
00:34:59,191 --> 00:35:03,149
If I were you, I would not bet a dime on his chance 'to get by.

485
00:35:03,179 --> 00:35:04,088
Lady.

486
00:35:05,567 --> 00:35:08,802
Ross, oh, sei a casa. Sei fradicio!

487
00:35:08,832 --> 00:35:11,210
Master, there are soldiers, they are coming here.

488
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:13,405

- Sollevalo. - Prudie.

492
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:21,771
Floor.

493
00:35:24,159 --> 00:35:26,199
Oh, good Lord, protect us.

494
00:35:26,229 --> 00:35:29,998
Oh, we're just ... just small sinners.

495
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:36,226
- You have no right ... - I have every right. Your husband and 'a wanted criminal.

496
00:35:36,256 --> 00:35:43,131
- My husband and 'in Truro and you will have to give an account of your behavior. - Rummage the house and put a man on guard in every room. - Upstairs!

- You do not enter the room of my child! - Each room!

And take the wounded prisoners in here. Come with me.

499
00:35:50,108 --> 00:35:51,895
- Wounded? - Yes'.

500
00:35:52,395 --> 00:35:55,174
If you want to make you useful, you can take care of them.

501
00:35:55,917 --> 00:36:00,582
What have you done? You shot the poor innocent men who have not ever hurt?

502
00:36:00,612 --> 00:36:05,009
Poldark lady, one of my men and 'was killed, another 7 or 8 wounded.

503
00:36:05,039 --> 00:36:09,038
My plan and 'was messed up by a careless gentleman and I have been up all night ...

504
00:36:09,068 --> 00:36:13,725
... And apparently you too, so I'm not in the mood to listen to your protestations of innocence.

505
00:36:13,755 --> 00:36:15,957
I know that Captain Poldark and 'here.

Come on, lady, be reasonable.

Tell me where is' and avoid any more trouble and perhaps more bloodshed.

510
00:36:28,856 --> 00:36:31,082
Okay, I'll be 'reasonable.

511
00:36:31,848 --> 00:36:36,329
You're just doing your duty, and I was just doing my for my husband.

00:36:36,745 --> 00:36:39,092
Captain Poldark not 'in Truro.

Ah ... so 'better.

00:36:52,698 --> 00:36:53,708
A St. Ives.

518
00:36:54,799 --> 00:36:56,942
That the Devil take you, ma'am.

519
00:36:56,972 --> 00:37:00,659
The Devil and 'Cornish and take' you first.

00:37:05,926 --> 00:37:07,993
You, them ', come back here.

00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:20,009
Where 'your master, Jud Paynter?

524
00:37:20,129 --> 00:37:23,969
- The young or the old? - Still tricks. The old.

525
00:37:23,999 --> 00:37:25,547
Ahhh... in Paradiso.

526
00:37:25,577 --> 00:37:29,591
Before your Honor you ask me, the young ...

527
00:37:29,621 --> 00:37:32,170
... And 'in his cot, he is sleeping like a baby.

528
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:34,907
Where 'Captain Poldark?

529
00:37:34,937 --> 00:37:36,477
Ah, the middle?

530
00:37:36,507 --> 00:37:40,780
It can 'be in one place or another. It 'on earth,' below.

531
00:37:41,887 --> 00:37:44,142
You ', I've said enough, old fool.

532
00:37:44,172 --> 00:37:47,119
Hey, you can not treat my house as if it were your own.

533
00:37:47,149 --> 00:37:48,505
Oh yes'? I can not, ma'am?

534
00:37:48,535 --> 00:37:54,041
Well, as you see, I'm doing it. And lighthouse 'here my Headquarters. You bring me a chair.

535
00:37:56,795 --> 00:37:58,086

...the'.

537
00:38:07,396 --> 00:38:09,855
You can not treat as stupid a Scotsman.

538
00:38:10,345 --> 00:38:13,981
Here and here are rest until 'do not take that man.

539
00:38:16,103 --> 00:38:19,981
I ', well, now berro' that glass of wine, ma'am, if you please.

540
00:38:32,313 --> 00:38:34,693
Dwight, are you okay?

541
00:38:37,274 --> 00:38:38,095
Ross?

542
00:38:39,344 --> 00:38:40,364
Is fine.

543
00:38:41,395 --> 00:38:42,630
Thank God.

544
00:38:43,264 --> 00:38:45,347
- E tu e Caroline?

545
00:38:46,128 --> 00:38:49,908
- ... Will understand '. I pray that God understands. - Lady.

546
00:38:53,993 --> 00:38:55,718
We have been betrayed.

547
00:38:56,643 --> 00:38:59,460
- They knew everything. - Do not worry.

548
00:39:00,164 --> 00:39:02,574
The captain ... they also know him?

549
00:39:02,604 --> 00:39:04,426
I do not know. Maybe not.

550
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:07,636
There were Jud, Zacky, I ...

551
00:39:11,207 --> 00:39:13,106
- Charlie Kempthorne.
- Shh...

552
00:39:14,156 --> 00:39:14,978
Prudie ...

553
00:39:15,754 --> 00:39:18,042
... Bring me a bowl of cold water.

554
00:39:21,062 --> 00:39:23,459
What should you do you will '.

555
00:39:59,313 --> 00:40:01,641
There are soldiers all Nampara.

556
00:40:03,099 --> 00:40:05,039
They took Paul Daniel ...

557
00:40:05,507 --> 00:40:06,824
Will Nanfan...

558
00:40:07,598 --> 00:40:09,017
Ned Bottrill ...

559
00:40:09,893 --> 00:40:11,486
Whitehead Scobey ...

560
00:40:11,813 --> 00:40:13,314
Ted Garkick...

561
00:40:13,914 --> 00:40:15,262
Pally Rogers...

562
00:40:17,416 --> 00:40:18,462
Dr. Enys.

563
00:40:18,492 --> 00:40:19,327
Oh, no.

564
00:40:20,061 --> 00:40:23,063
And 'he was to light a fire that put us in alarm, I think.

565
00:40:23,093 --> 00:40:24,299
And the captain?

566
00:40:25,328 --> 00:40:26,342
Non lo so.

567
00:40:27,174 --> 00:40:28,603
But it 's already serious' so'.

568
00:40:30,051 --> 00:40:31,910
I spoke with one of the soldiers.

569
00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:33,659
He told me...

570
00:40:34,256 --> 00:40:36,850
... Who had heard everything from an informant.

571
00:40:39,289 --> 00:40:40,692
Did he say anything?

572
00:40:41,124 --> 00:40:42,422
Not a word.

573
00:40:42,879 --> 00:40:44,472
But that says it all.

574
00:40:45,651 --> 00:40:48,603
We'll leave it at Trencrom or settle it by themselves?

575
00:40:48,633 --> 00:40:52,117
No, men Trencrom are gone. Our we have been captured.

576
00:40:52,147 --> 00:40:53,683
It's up to us to judge.

577
00:40:54,636 --> 00:40:56,852
- At the old way? - Yes'...

578
00:40:57,248 --> 00:40:58,811
... The old fashioned way.

579
00:41:21,815 --> 00:41:24,838
To mark time and to give him a fair trial.

580
00:41:25,895 --> 00:41:30,562
Those who want to testify against Kempthorne, have until in the middle 'of the candle.

581
00:41:30,835 --> 00:41:34,216
Those who want to speak on his behalf, have the other half '.

582
00:41:35,408 --> 00:41:36,715
For the opinion ...

583
00:41:37,479 --> 00:41:40,040
... If the candle is consumed to the water ...

584
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:41,433
... He 's innocent.

585
00:41:42,192 --> 00:41:43,851
If you turn off before ...

586
00:41:44,610 --> 00:41:45,830
... And 'guilty.

587
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,592
God is the judge.

588
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,008
Who speaks first?

589
00:41:55,073 --> 00:41:55,945
Rosina.

590
00:41:56,490 --> 00:41:59,807
No, girl, do not be afraid. I was unfair to you.

591
00:41:59,837 --> 00:42:01,955
Tell 'em what you told me.

592
00:42:02,490 --> 00:42:05,482
Charlie said he had a fever, but it was not true.

593
00:42:05,714 --> 00:42:10,308
My father beat me and I ran to the doctor, and he said he had not seen Charlie ...

594
00:42:10,338 --> 00:42:12,269
... And that was in Sawle with me.

595
00:42:22,438 --> 00:42:24,945
How can 'hold out?

596
00:42:25,716 --> 00:42:27,088
Non te lo so dire.

597
00:42:28,747 --> 00:42:30,034
We expect.

598
00:42:30,442 --> 00:42:31,545
Demelza ...

599
00:42:32,217 --> 00:42:35,005
... And 'impossible that it takes much longer.

600
00:42:35,962 --> 00:42:38,932
There 'no law that says What' impossible.

601
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:42,363
If there was a law, it would violate the Ross.

602
00:42:57,807 --> 00:42:59,237
Captain McNeil ...

603
00:42:59,267 --> 00:43:04,014
- The man who was shot in the leg must be taken to the hospital. - Oh, I will, 'Ms.

604
00:43:04,044 --> 00:43:07,154
And if it is' too late? If you have to cut off his leg?

605
00:43:07,184 --> 00:43:09,350
It 's not my responsibility'.

606
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:14,135
Captain Poldark and 'here. You tell me where is' and I'm leaving.

607
00:43:14,696 --> 00:43:17,135
If you so 'sure it's here,' cause you take it?

608
00:43:17,165 --> 00:43:19,206
You show me where you hide and I will '.

609
00:43:19,236 --> 00:43:21,926
You want me to betray my own husband.

610
00:43:22,052 --> 00:43:27,575
You have tried to make fun of me, mademoiselle Demelza, and that I will not lose.

611
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:29,704
Now I will show you 'who among us and' the stupid.

612
00:43:29,734 --> 00:43:32,012
That 'your duty, I suppose.

613
00:43:32,042 --> 00:43:35,758
- No, and 'my pleasure. - Well, to hell with your pleasure!

614
00:43:35,788 --> 00:43:40,699
- This is not 'a language suitable for a lady. - I was not talking to the ears of a gentleman.

615
00:43:46,410 --> 00:43:47,993
May. May!

616
00:43:50,012 --> 00:43:51,940
The soldiers had surrounded us.

617
00:43:51,970 --> 00:43:54,657
They knew the time, knew the place.

618
00:43:54,687 --> 00:44:00,205
They knew they were going to Nampara, later, to see the captain. Who could have told them everything ', eh?

619
00:44:00,235 --> 00:44:03,973
- Only Kempthorne! - Yes'. you '... - Who had a bag full of gold?

620
00:44:04,259 --> 00:44:07,306
- Solo Kempthorne!
- Si', si'...
- Kempthorne!!!

621
00:44:07,493 --> 00:44:11,189
I beat my daughter 'cause she did not want to marry him.

622
00:44:11,219 --> 00:44:12,399
That rat.

623
00:44:13,553 --> 00:44:15,406
Anyone else want to speak?

624
00:44:17,850 --> 00:44:19,576
The time and 'almost finished.

625
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:24,815
Who wants to speak in his favor?

626
00:44:30,085 --> 00:44:33,494
Then let them speak in his defense. Bring him to the table.

627
00:44:42,450 --> 00:44:44,594
Man walks of your life.

628
00:44:49,747 --> 00:44:51,044
I do not know anything.

629
00:44:51,971 --> 00:44:53,441
They are innocent.

630
00:44:53,471 --> 00:44:55,627
Speak, man. Where did you get the gold?

631
00:44:57,524 --> 00:44:58,593
Innocent.

632
00:45:04,195 --> 00:45:06,013
You have nothing to say?

633
00:45:09,432 --> 00:45:10,801
They are innocent.

634
00:45:13,249 --> 00:45:14,740
They are innocent.

635
00:45:25,484 --> 00:45:26,453
So it is'.

636
00:45:27,136 --> 00:45:28,831
So it is'. It was me.

637
00:45:30,054 --> 00:45:31,039
So be it.

638
00:45:31,941 --> 00:45:33,466
Damn traitor!

639
00:45:34,209 --> 00:45:37,148
I curse you, for your sake and my man 'was caught!

640
00:45:37,178 --> 00:45:40,937
Whatever we will do and 'not enough for him!

641
00:45:40,967 --> 00:45:43,794
Who will feed 'my children right now who have taken my husband?

642
00:45:43,824 --> 00:45:47,350
- You Judas! - Leave him alone!

643
00:45:49,858 --> 00:45:51,891
What will be 'fact' enough.

644
00:46:06,556 --> 00:46:08,052
The old way.

645
00:46:09,932 --> 00:46:11,918
Zacky when he made the sign ...

646
00:46:13,044 --> 00:46:15,056
... Cut the wick straight.

647
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:22,138
Come, daughter.

648
00:46:34,169 --> 00:46:35,739
- Lord. - What do you want?

649
00:46:35,769 --> 00:46:37,700
I carried the wounded on the bandwagon, sir.

650
00:46:37,730 --> 00:46:42,444
- If we get to camp before dark, we should leave now, sir. - We will start when I say so.

651
00:46:42,474 --> 00:46:43,698
Yes, sir.

652
00:46:43,728 --> 00:46:46,062
- Just ... - Just anything, Sergeant.

653
00:46:52,269 --> 00:46:53,300
Prudie ...

654
00:46:53,586 --> 00:46:57,628
... The captain will have 'hunger when he returns to St. Ives. Go to prepare dinner.

655
00:46:57,658 --> 00:46:58,961
Stay where you are!

656
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:03,069
You think you're clever, but I know that you are not.

657
00:47:03,209 --> 00:47:07,272
You think you're saving Poldark, but I tell you that you could even kill him.

658
00:47:07,302 --> 00:47:09,961
Maybe 'already' in his grave.

659
00:47:11,903 --> 00:47:16,161
You think you have me fooled, but the only ones who have teased you are.

660
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:19,325
Prudie ...

661
00:47:19,871 --> 00:47:21,985
... When you go into the kitchen ...

662
00:47:22,422 --> 00:47:28,371
... Preparing a warmer for the master's bed. The ride from St. Ives and 'long and cold.

663
00:49:14,682 --> 00:49:15,708
Sergeant!

664
00:49:18,593 --> 00:49:19,346
Lord?

665
00:49:19,376 --> 00:49:23,390
Bring two men and two guards for a prisoner and get ready to march.

666
00:49:23,420 --> 00:49:24,320
Lord.

667
00:49:25,584 --> 00:49:27,174
You two, upstairs!

668
00:49:29,521 --> 00:49:30,807
Sollevatelo.

669
00:49:36,343 --> 00:49:37,997
Lift tables.

670
00:49:42,978 --> 00:49:45,577
Captain Poldark, you should come on now!

671
00:49:50,878 --> 00:49:51,669
Ross.
